The Invention of Wings|Sue Monk Kidd|Writing at the height of her narrative and imaginative gifts, Sue Monk Kidd presents a masterpiece of hope, daring, the quest for freedom, and the desire to have a voice in the world—and it is now the newest Oprah’s Book Club 2.0 selection.Hetty “Handful” Grimke, an urban slave in early nineteenth century Charleston, yearns for life beyond the suffocating walls that enclose her within the wealthy Grimke household. The Grimke’s daughter, Sarah, has known from an early age she is meant to do something large in the world, but she is hemmed in by the limits imposed on women.Kidd’s sweeping novel is set in motion on Sarah’s eleventh birthday, when she is given ownership of ten year old Handful, who is to be her handmaid. We follow their remarkable journeys over the next thirty five years, as both strive for a life of their own, dramatically shaping each other’s destinies and forming a complex relationship marked by guilt, defiance, estrangement and the uneasy ways of love.As the stories build to a riveting climax, Handful will endure loss and sorrow, finding courage and a sense of self in the process. Sarah will experience crushed hopes, betrayal, unrequited love, and ostracism before leaving Charleston to find her place alongside her fearless younger sister, Angelina, as one of the early pioneers in the abolition and women’s rights movements.Inspired by the historical figure of Sarah Grimke, Kidd goes beyond the record to flesh out the rich interior lives of all of her characters, both real and invented, including Handful’s cunning mother, Charlotte, who courts danger in her search for something better.This exquisitely written novel is a triumph of storytelling that looks with unswerving eyes at a devastating wound in American history, through women whose struggles for liberation, empowerment, and expression will leave no reader unmoved.|Hardcover||384.0|January 7, 2014|Viking||920L||635.0287999999998|4.24|4.7|277659.0|16300.0|16.1798|2.9718|24.1808|Historical Fiction|Fiction|Historical|Book Club|Audiobook|Adult Fiction|Adult|Novels|African American|Southern|0.4854657564413125|0.2756000880863246|0.06760625412904647|0.04118035674961462|0.031270645232327685|0.029398810834617924|0.027086544813917642|0.014974675181678044|0.014314027747192247|0.013102840783968287|237199.91

Habibi|Craig Thompson|From the internationally acclaimed author of Blankets , a highly anticipated new graphic novel. Sprawling across an epic landscape of deserts, harems, and modern industrial clutter, Habibi tells the tale of Dodola and Zam, refugee child slaves bound to each other by chance, by circumstance, and by the love that grows between them.

To Sir, with Love|Lauren Layne|"Love Is Blind
 meets 
You’ve Got Mail
 in this laugh-out-loud romantic comedy following two thirty-somethings who meet on a blind dating app—only to realize that their online chemistry is nothing compared to their offline rivalry.Perpetually cheerful and eager to please, Gracie Cooper strives to make the best out of every situation. So when her father dies just months after a lung cancer diagnosis, she sets aside her dreams of pursuing her passion for art to take over his Midtown Manhattan champagne shop. She soon finds out that the store’s profit margins are being squeezed perilously tight, and complicating matters further, a giant corporation headed by the impossibly handsome, but irritatingly arrogant Sebastian Andrews is proposing a buyout. But Gracie can’t bear the thought of throwing away her father’s dream like she did her own. Overwhelmed and not wanting to admit to her friends or family that she’s having second thoughts about the shop, Gracie seeks advice and solace from someone she’s never met—the faceless “Sir”, with whom she connected on a blind dating app where matches get to know each other through messages and common interests before exchanging real names or photos. But although Gracie finds herself slowly falling for Sir online, she has no idea she’s already met him in real life…and they can’t stand each other."|Paperback||288.0|June 29, 2021|Gallery Books||||6441.0063999999975|4.18||378||13.4874|1.8288|20.955|Romance|Contemporary|Contemporary Romance|Adult|Chick Lit|Fiction|Adult Fiction|Clean Romance|New Adult Romance||0.4541484716157205|0.1615720524017467|0.1091703056768559|0.09170305676855896|0.08296943231441048|0.0480349344978166|0.034934497816593885|0.008733624454148471|0.008733624454148471||209192.13

Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first person to die there.After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet.

Gilead|Marilynne Robinson|"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Critics Circle Award, Gilead is a hymn of praise and lamentation to the God-haunted existence that Reverend Ames loves passionately, and from which he will soon part.In 1956, toward the end of Reverend John Ames's life, he begins a letter to his young son, an account of himself and his forebears. Ames is the son of an Iowan preacher and the grandson of a minister who, as a young man in Maine, saw a vision of Christ bound in chains and came west to Kansas to fight for abolition: He ""preached men into the Civil War,"" then, at age fifty, became a chaplain in the Union Army, losing his right eye in battle. Reverend Ames writes to his son about the tension between his father--an ardent pacifist--and his grandfather, whose pistol and bloody shirts, concealed in an army blanket, may be relics from the fight between the abolitionists and those settlers who wanted to vote Kansas into the union as a slave state. And he tells a story of the sacred bonds between fathers and sons, which are tested in his tender and strained relationship with his namesake, John Ames Boughton, his best friend's wayward son.This is also the tale of another remarkable vision--not a corporeal vision of God but the vision of life as a wondrously strange creation. It tells how wisdom was forged in Ames's soul during his solitary life, and how history lives through generations, pervasively present even when betrayed and forgotten."|Paperback|Oprah's Book Club edition|247.0|August 4, 2020|Picador Paper||||3628.736|3.84|4.3|89834|3402.0|13.8176|1.6256000000000002|21.1074|Fiction|Historical Fiction|Religion|Novels|Literary Fiction|Literature|Classics|Audiobook|Contemporary|American|0.5656742556917689|0.13819455500716446|0.05253940455341506|0.04919598790001592|0.04919598790001592|0.046170991880273834|0.02658812291036459|0.02547365069256488|0.024359178474765163|0.022607864989651328|151444.13
Kel Gilligan's Daredevil Stunt Show|Michael Buckley|From Michael Buckley, the bestselling author of the Sisters Grimm and NERDS series, and Dan Santat, author-illustrator of Sidekicks, comes this hilarious picture book starring Kel Gilligan (a.k.a. “The Boy Without Fear”) that encourages kids to laugh at their fears and celebrates the bravery it takes to try new things no matter how ordinary.

Bold, interactive, and downright silly, this is a book to make kids cheer and attempt some “stunts” of their own.|Hardcover||40.0|September 1, 2012|Harry N.

The Second World War|Antony Beevor|A masterful and comprehensive chronicle of World War II, by internationally bestselling historian Antony Beevor. Over the past two decades, Antony Beevor has established himself as one of the world's premier historians of WWII. His multi-award winning books have included Stalingrad and The Fall of Berlin 1945. Now, in his newest and most ambitious book, he turns his focus to one of the bloodiest and most tragic events of the twentieth century, the Second World War.

The result is a dramatic and breathtaking single-volume history that provides a remarkably intimate account of the war that, more than any other, still commands attention and an audience.  Thrillingly written and brilliantly researched, Beevor's grand and provocative account is destined to become the definitive work on this complex, tragic, and endlessly fascinating period in world history, and confirms once more that he is a military historian of the first rank.|Hardcover||863.0|June 5, 2012|Little, Brown and Company||||1233.77024|4.38|4.7|7047|1409.0|16.2052|4.7752|24.460200000000004|History|Nonfiction|War|World War II|Military History|Military Fiction|Historical|Politics|World History|Russia|0.5205479452054794|0.1972602739726028|0.0952054794520548|0.07260273972602739|0.04041095890410959|0.024657534246575345|0.01643835616438356|0.011643835616438357|0.011643835616438357|0.009589041095890413|230270.15

Maine|J. Courtney Sullivan|In her best-selling debut, Commencement, J. Courtney Sullivan explored the complicated and contradictory landscape of female friendship. Now, in her highly anticipated second novel, Sullivan takes us into even richer territory, introducing four unforgettable women who have nothing in common but the fact that, like it or not, they’re family.For the Kellehers, Maine is a place where children run in packs, showers are taken outdoors, and old Irish songs are sung around a piano. Their beachfront property, won on a barroom bet after the war, sits on three acres of sand and pine nestled between stretches of rocky coast, with one tree bearing the initials “A.H.” At the cottage, built by Kelleher hands, cocktail hour follows morning mass, nosy grandchildren snoop in drawers, and decades-old grudges simmer beneath the surface.As three generations of Kelleher women descend on the property one summer, each brings her own hopes and fears. Maggie is thirty-two and pregnant, waiting for the perfect moment to tell her imperfect boyfriend the news; Ann Marie, a Kelleher by marriage, is channeling her domestic frustration into a dollhouse obsession and an ill-advised crush; Kathleen, the black sheep, never wanted to set foot in the cottage again; and Alice, the matriarch at the center of it all, would trade every floorboard for a chance to undo the events of one night, long ago.By turns wickedly funny and achingly sad, Maine unveils the sibling rivalry, alcoholism, social climbing, and Catholic guilt at the center of one family, along with the abiding, often irrational love that keeps them coming back, every summer, to Maine and to each other.|Hardcover||388.0|June 14, 2011|Knopf||||725.7472|3.38|4.0|32697.0|1032.0|16.764|4.0132|24.384|Fiction|Chick Lit|Contemporary|Adult Fiction|Audiobook|Family|Adult|Novels|Catholic|Literary Fiction|0.5417106652587117|0.13938753959873285|0.06441393875395987|0.05068637803590285|0.049630411826821534|0.044350580781415|0.03484688489968321|0.027455121436114043|0.024287222808870117|0.02323125659978881|346199.26

The City|Dean Koontz|The city changed my life and showed me that the world is deeply mysterious. I need to tell you about her and some terrible things and wonderful things and amazing things that happened . . . and how I am still haunted by them. Including one night when I died and woke and lived again.

The unforgettable saga of a young man coming of age within a remarkable family, and a shimmering portrait of the world that shaped him, The City is a novel that speaks to everyone, a dazzling realization of the evergreen dreams we all share. Brilliantly illumined by magic dark and light, it’s a place where enchantment and malice entwine, courage and honor are found in the most unexpected quarters, and the way forward lies buried deep inside the heart.|Hardcover||398.0|July 1, 2014|Bantam||||703.0676|3.86|4.4|12108.0|2272.0|16.2306|4.0132|24.51100000000001|Fiction|Horror|Thriller|Mystery|Fantasy|Paranormal|Suspense|Mystery Thriller|Audiobook|Supernatural|0.2602996254681648|0.22846441947565546|0.14232209737827714|0.12921348314606745|0.06179775280898876|0.05056179775280899|0.048689138576779034|0.033707865168539325|0.02247191011235955|0.02247191011235955|249038.25
The Pale King|David Foster Wallace|The agents at the IRS Regional Examination Center in Peoria, Illinois, appear ordinary enough to newly arrived trainee David Foster Wallace. But as he immerses himself in a routine so tedious and repetitive that new employees receive boredom-survival training, he learns of the extraordinary variety of personalities drawn to this strange calling. And he has arrived at a moment when forces within the IRS are plotting to eliminate even what little humanity and dignity the work still has.The Pale King remained unfinished at the time of David Foster Wallace's death, but it is a deeply compelling and satisfying novel, hilarious and fearless and as original as anything Wallace ever undertook. It grapples directly with ultimate questions--questions of life's meaning and of the value of work and society--through characters imagined with the interior force and generosity that were Wallace's unique gifts. Along the way it suggests a new idea of heroism and commands infinite respect for one of the most daring writers of our time.|Hardcover||548.0|April 15, 2011|Little, Brown and Company||||830.07336|3.96|4.4|15779.0|344.0|15.24|3.5052|23.495|Fiction|Novels|Contemporary|Literature|Literary Fiction|American|Unfinished|Audiobook|21st Century|Americana|0.6267657992565056|0.08921933085501857|0.06617100371747213|0.06468401486988848|0.0483271375464684|0.0379182156133829|0.0275092936802974|0.014126394052044609|0.013382899628252787|0.011895910780669143|519732.0

The Paris Wife|Paula McLain|A deeply evocative story of ambition and betrayal, The Paris Wife captures a remarkable period of time and a love affair between two unforgettable people: Ernest Hemingway and his wife Hadley. Chicago, 1920: Hadley Richardson is a quiet twenty-eight-year-old who has all but given up on love and happiness—until she meets Ernest Hemingway and her life changes forever. Following a whirlwind courtship and wedding, the pair set sail for Paris, where they become the golden couple in a lively and volatile group—the fabled “Lost Generation”—that includes Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. Though deeply in love, the Hemingways are ill prepared for the hard-drinking and fast-living life of Jazz Age Paris, which hardly values traditional notions of family and monogamy. Surrounded by beautiful women and competing egos, Ernest struggles to find the voice that will earn him a place in history, pouring all the richness and intensity of his life with Hadley and their circle of friends into the novel that will become The Sun Also Rises. Hadley, meanwhile, strives to hold on to her sense of self as the demands of life with Ernest grow costly and her roles as wife, friend, and muse become more challenging. Despite their extraordinary bond, they eventually find themselves facing the ultimate crisis of their marriage—a deception that will lead to the unraveling of everything they’ve fought so hard for. A heartbreaking portrayal of love and torn loyalty, The Paris Wife is all the more poignant because we know that, in the end, Hemingway wrote that he would rather have died than fallen in love with anyone but Hadley.|Hardcover||314.0|February 22, 2011|Ballantine Books||||612.3492|3.81|4.4|277463.0|4355.0|16.8402|2.4384|24.2062|Historical Fiction|Fiction|Historical|Romance|France|Book Club|Adult Fiction|Audiobook|Adult|Novels|0.4720625431133594|0.25948493906645204|0.05679466544033111|0.04575764543573235|0.04115888710048287|0.0400091975166705|0.024143481260059784|0.024028512301678545|0.022648884801103702|0.013911243964129684|268239.46

The Woman's Hour: The Great Fight to Win the Vote|Elaine F. Weiss|The nail-biting climax of one of the greatest political victories in American history: the down and dirty campaign to get the last state to ratify the 19th amendment, granting women the right to vote.Nashville, August 1920. Thirty-five states have ratified the Nineteenth Amendment, twelve have rejected or refused to vote, and one last state is needed. It all comes down to Tennessee, the moment of truth for the suffragists, after a seven-decade crusade. The opposing forces include politicians with careers at stake, liquor companies, railroad magnates, and a lot of racists who don't want black women voting. And then there are the 'Antis'--women who oppose their own enfranchisement, fearing suffrage will bring about the moral collapse of the nation. They all converge in a boiling hot summer for a vicious face-off replete with dirty tricks, betrayals and bribes, bigotry, Jack Daniel's, and the Bible.Following a handful of remarkable women who led their respective forces into battle, along with appearances by Woodrow Wilson, Warren Harding, Frederick Douglass, and Eleanor Roosevelt, The Woman's Hour is an inspiring story of activists winning their own freedom in one of the last campaigns forged in the shadow of the Civil War, and the beginning of the great twentieth-century battles for civil rights.|Hardcover||416.0|||||||4.03|4.5|2903.0|463.0||||History|Nonfiction|Feminism|Politics|Womens|American History|Historical|Audiobook|American|Adult|0.32232841007819285|0.3014769765421373|0.13466550825369245|0.09643788010425716|0.03822762814943528|0.036490008688097306|0.025195482189400518|0.02432667245873154|0.010425716768027804|0.010425716768027804|241819.75

Hark! A Vagrant|Kate Beaton|"Hark! A Vagrant is an uproarious romp through history and literature seen through the sharp, contemporary lens of New Yorker cartoonist and comics-sensation Kate Beaton. No era or tome emerges unscathbed as Beaton rightly skewers the Western world's revolutionaries, leaders, sycophants, and suffragists while equally honing her wit on the hapless heroes, heroines, and villains of the best-loved fiction. She deftly points out what really happened when Brahms fell asleep listening to Liszt, that the world's first hipsters were obviously the Incroyables and the Merveilleuses from eighteenth-century France, that Susan B. Anthony is, of course, a ""Samantha,"" and that the polite banality of Canadian culture never gets old. Hark! A Vagrant features sexy Batman, the true stories behind classic Nancy Drew covers, and Queen Elizabeth doing the albatross. As the 5600.000 unique monthly visitors to harkavagrant.com already know, no one turns the ironic absurdities of history and literature into comedic fodder as hilarious as Beaton."|Hardcover||168.0|September 27, 2011|Drawn and Quarterly||||698.5316799999997|4.23|4.6|23421.0|252.0|13.8938|2.3876|22.3266|Graphic Novels|Comics|Humor|History|Historical|Graphic Novels Comics|Nonfiction|Comedy|Canada|Adult|0.310438207779419|0.2710487444608567|0.14623338257016247|0.11250615460364352|0.03741999015263417|0.028311176760216644|0.027326440177252585|0.026587887740029542|0.0241260462826194|0.016001969473165928|120548.95
Girls Burn Brighter|Shobha   Rao|A searing, electrifying debut novel set in India and America, about a once-in-a-lifetime friendship between two girls who are driven apart but never stop trying to find one another again.When Poornima first meets Savitha, she feels something she thought she lost for good when her mother died: hope. Poornima's father hires Savitha to work one of their sari looms, and the two girls are quickly drawn to one another. Savitha is even more impoverished than Poornima, but she is full of passion and energy. She shows Poornima how to find beauty in a bolt of indigo cloth, a bowl of yogurt rice and bananas, the warmth of friendship. Suddenly their Indian village doesn't feel quite so claustrophobic, and Poornima begins to imagine a life beyond the arranged marriage her father is desperate to lock down for her. But when a devastating act of cruelty drives Savitha away, Poornima leaves behind everything she has ever known to find her friend again. Her journey takes her into the darkest corners of India's underworld, on a harrowing cross-continental journey, and eventually to an apartment complex in Seattle. Alternating between the girls’ perspectives as they face relentless obstacles, Girls Burn Brighter introduces two heroines who never lose the hope that burns within them.

Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us|Michael Moss|"Every year, the average American eats 33 pounds of cheese and 70 pounds of sugar. They ingest 8,500 milligrams of salt a day, double the recommended amount, almost none of which comes from salt shakers. It comes from processed food, an industry that hauls in $1 trillion in annual sales. In Salt Sugar Fat, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Michael Moss shows how this happened. Featuring examples from some of the most recognizable (and profitable) companies and brands of the last half century--including Kraft, Coca-Cola, Lunchables, Kellogg, Nestlé, Oreos, Cargill, Capri Sun, and many more--Moss’s explosive, empowering narrative is grounded in meticulous, often eye-opening research. He goes inside the labs where food scientists use cutting-edge technology to calculate the ""bliss point"" of sugary beverages or enhance the ""mouth feel"" of fat by manipulating its chemical structure. He unearths marketing techniques taken straight from tobacco company playbooks to redirect concerns about the health risks of products. He talks to concerned executives who explain that they could never produce truly healthy alternatives to their products even if serious regulation became a reality. Simply put: the industry itself would cease to exist without salt, sugar, and fat."|Hardcover||480.0|February 26, 2013|Random House||||775.6423199999997|3.98|4.6|28353.0|1766.0|16.3576|3.2004|24.2316|Nonfiction|Food|Health|Science|Nutrition|Audiobook|Business|History|Cooking|Politics|0.41678602119736463|0.20681753079346893|0.14723574906903467|0.08307075336579776|0.0495560011458035|0.02979089086221713|0.02320252076768834|0.02148381552563736|0.011171584073331424|0.01088513319965626|509626.1

Healing with Cannabis: The Evolution of the Endocannabinoid System and How Cannabinoids Help Relieve PTSD, Pain, MS, Anxiety, and More|Cheryl Pellerin|An informative read for an audience interested in why and how medical cannabis helps treat a range of illnesses—maybe all of them.With cannabis approved in 14 states (including the District and 2 US territories), medical cannabis approved in at least 35 states, and hemp (very-low-THC cannabis) off the controlled substances list, millions now treat their ills with medical cannabis or non-intoxicating cannabinoids like CBD. But lots of them don’t know why or how cannabis works in the body.Healing with Cannabis has two parts.First is a scientific but not too technical story of the endocannabinoid system, a billion-year-old system in vertebrates that allows cannabis to work in the body and brain. But its main role in the body is homeostasis—a state of balance—so it's an essential regulatory mechanism in the basic machinery of everyday life, not just about cannabis.In part 2, about medical cannabis, interviews with some of the best international cannabinoid researchers tell why and how cannabis helps treat PTSD, pain, MS, anxiety, some elements of cancer, and many others. The book also describes clinical trials and has a resources section.

It is a time that would see him trade the extraordinary power he had created for himself as Senate Majority Leader for what became the wretched powerlessness of a Vice President in an administration that disdained and distrusted him. Yet it was, as well, the time in which the presidency, the goal he had always pursued, would be thrust upon him in the moment it took an assassin’s bullet to reach its mark.By 1958, as Johnson began to maneuver for the presidency, he was known as one of the most brilliant politicians of his time, the greatest Senate Leader in our history. But the 1960 nomination would go to the young senator from Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy. Caro gives us an unparalleled account of the machinations behind both the nomination and Kennedy’s decision to offer Johnson the vice presidency, revealing the extent of Robert Kennedy’s efforts to force Johnson off the ticket. With the consummate skill of a master storyteller, he exposes the savage animosity between Johnson and Kennedy’s younger brother, portraying one of America’s great political feuds. Yet Robert Kennedy’s overt contempt for Johnson was only part of the burden of humiliation and isolation he bore as Vice President. With a singular understanding of Johnson’s heart and mind, Caro describes what it was like for this mighty politician to find himself altogether powerless in a world in which power is the crucial commodity. For the first time, in Caro’s breathtakingly vivid narrative, we see the Kennedy assassination through Lyndon Johnson’s eyes. We watch Johnson step into the presidency, inheriting a staff fiercely loyal to his slain predecessor; a Congress determined to retain its power over the executive branch; and a nation in shock and mourning. We see how within weeks—grasping the reins of the presidency with supreme mastery—he propels through Congress essential legislation that at the time of Kennedy’s death seemed hopelessly logjammed and seizes on a dormant Kennedy program to create the revolutionary War on Poverty. Caro makes clear how the political genius with which Johnson had ruled the Senate now enabled him to make the presidency wholly his own. This was without doubt Johnson’s finest hour, before his aspirations and accomplishments were overshadowed and eroded by the trap of Vietnam.In its exploration of this pivotal period in Johnson’s life—and in the life of the nation—The Passage of Power is not only the story of how he surmounted unprecedented obstacles in order to fulfill the highest purpose of the presidency but is, as well, a revelation of both the pragmatic potential in the presidency and what can be accomplished when the chief executive has the vision and determination to move beyond the pragmatic and initiate programs designed to transform a nation.|Hardcover||712.0|May 1, 2012|Knopf||||1251.91392|4.29|4.7|17064|1272.0|16.764|5.6388000000000025|24.257|Biography|History|Politics|Nonfiction|American History|Presidents|Biography Memoir|Us Presidents|Audiobook|American|0.2941523922031896|0.2746603662138216|0.13467217956290609|0.12463083284111046|0.06024808033077377|0.057885410513880686|0.02008269344359126|0.01772002362669817|0.008269344359125812|0.007678676904902541|562898.63
Turn Right at Machu Picchu: Rediscovering the Lost City One Step at a Time|Mark    Adams|What happens when an adventure travel expert-who's never actually done anything adventurous-tries to re-create the original expedition to Machu Picchu?  July 24, 1911, was a day for the history books. For on that rainy morning, the young Yale professor Hiram Bingham III climbed into the Andes Mountains of Peru and encountered an ancient city in the clouds: the now famous citadel of Machu Picchu. Nearly a century later, news reports have recast the hero explorer as a villain who smuggled out priceless artifacts and stole credit for finding one of the world's greatest archaeological sites. Mark Adams has spent his career editing adventure and travel magazines, so his plan to investigate the allegations against Bingham by retracing the explorer's perilous path to Machu Picchu isn't completely far- fetched, even if it does require him to sleep in a tent for the first time. With a crusty, antisocial Australian survivalist and several Quechua-speaking, coca-chewing mule tenders as his guides, Adams takes readers through some of the most gorgeous and historic landscapes in Peru, from the ancient Inca capital of Cusco to the enigmatic ruins of Vitcos and Vilcabamba.  Along the way he finds a still-undiscovered country populated with brilliant and eccentric characters, as well as an answer to the question that has nagged scientists since Hiram Bingham's time: Just what was Machu Picchu?|Hardcover||333.0|June 30, 2011|Dutton Adult|18 years and up|||589.6696|3.85|4.5|15919.0|1015.0|16.0274|3.1242|23.5712|Travel|Nonfiction|History|Adventure|Memoir|Biography|Travelogue|Archaeology|Historical|Biography Memoir|0.3674443266171792|0.2831389183457052|0.17391304347826084|0.06203605514316012|0.043478260869565216|0.022799575821845167|0.01325556733828208|0.012725344644750796|0.012195121951219513|0.009013785790031814|342156.9

The Law of Success: Napoleon Hill's Writings on Personal Achievement, Wealth and Lasting Success (Official Publication of the Napoleon Hill Foundation)|Napoleon Hill|Napoleon Hill’s Original Master Class on Individual Achievement Before the landmark book Think and Grow Rich came The Law of Success, an eight-volume series in which Hill presents the complete Science of Success philosophy. Originally published in 1928, this success system contains sixteen lessons on personal achievement, gleaned from interviews with and research on over 500 top performers from various industries and walks of life. Now condensed for your convenience into one compact volume curated by the Trustees of the Napoleon Hill Foundation, The Law of Success details the exact steps by which any individual can harness the power of thought to turn their dreams into reality. This is much more than a guide or roadmap; it is a total lifestyle makeover, with concrete resources for everyday application. If you are serious about becoming the best version of yourself in your field, your relationships, your health, and your finances, then you are ready for the original master class on success. ~ A message from the executive director and CEO of the Napoleon Hill Foundation ~ There have been many requests over the years for a version that is more concise and compact yet contains the core lessons discovered and set forth in the discussion of the sixteen success principles. The Trustees of the Napoleon Hill Foundation heard these requests and took on the task of producing such a book, containing what they viewed as the essential lessons and most important portions of the original work, and what you are about to read is the result. This version has dispensed with the third party quotations and “After the Lesson” essays in the original work, deleted some stories that were repeated in other of Hill’s books published after 1928, and eliminated repetition (rightly valued by Mr. Hill as a learning method but not appropriate for a compact volume.) The Trustees believe, and hope you will agree, that the resulting volume contains all the essential wisdom of this groundbreaking work, Law of Success. I have been the Executive Director of the Napoleon Hill Foundation since 2000, and I and the other Trustees who contributed to this work have nearly 200 years combined years of service to the Foundation. I believe they are singularly equipped to produce the best distillation of Napoleon Hill’s seminal work and am proud to present this book for your enjoyment, appreciation, and education. —Don M.

Prague Winter: A Personal Story of Remembrance and War, 1937-1948|Madeleine K. Albright|"Before Madeleine Albright turned twelve, her life was shaken by the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia—the country where she was born—the Battle of Britain, the near total destruction of European Jewry, the Allied victory in World War II, the rise of communism, and the onset of the Cold War.Albright's experiences, and those of her family, provide a lens through which to view the most tumultuous dozen years in modern history. Drawing on her memory, her parents' written reflections, interviews with contemporaries, and newly available documents, Albright recounts a tale that is by turns harrowing and inspiring. Prague Winter is an exploration of the past with timeless dilemmas in mind and, simultaneously, a journey with universal lessons that is intensely personal.The book takes readers from the Bohemian capital's thousand-year-old castle to the bomb shelters of London, from the desolate prison ghetto of Terezín to the highest councils of European and American government. Albright reflects on her discovery of her family's Jewish heritage many decades after the war, on her Czech homeland's tangled history, and on the stark moral choices faced by her parents and their generation. Often relying on eyewitness descriptions, she tells the story of how millions of ordinary citizens were ripped from familiar surroundings and forced into new roles as exiled leaders and freedom fighters, resistance organizers and collaborators, victims and killers. These events of enormous complexity are never-theless shaped by concepts familiar to any growing child: fear, trust, adaptation, the search for identity, the pressure to conform, the quest for independence, and the difference between right and wrong.""No one who lived through the years of 1937 to 1948,"" Albright writes, ""was a stranger to profound sadness. Millions of innocents did not survive, and their deaths must never be forgotten. Today we lack the power to reclaim lost lives, but we have a duty to learn all that we can about what happened and why."" At once a deeply personal memoir and an incisive work of history, Prague Winter serves as a guide to the future through the lessons of the past—as seen through the eyes of one of the international community's most respected and fascinating figures."|Hardcover|First Edition|467.0|April 24, 2012|Harper||||884.5043999999997|4.0|4.5|6530|791.0|2.9718|13.614400000000002|19.9644|Nonfiction|History|Memoir|Biography|World War II|Biography Memoir|War|Holocaust|Politics|Autobiography|0.26512455516014233|0.23665480427046265|0.14857651245551598|0.13345195729537365|0.0596085409252669|0.04181494661921708|0.03469750889679715|0.029359430604982206|0.027580071174377226|0.023131672597864767|404091.63

Love Story|Jennifer Echols|"She's writing about him. He's writing about her. And everybody is reading between the lines..
For Erin Blackwell, majoring in creative writing at the New York City college of her dreams is more than a chance to fulfill her ambitions--it's her ticket away from the tragic memories that shadow her family's racehorse farm in Kentucky. But when she refuses to major in business and take over the farm herself someday, her grandmother gives Erin's college tuition and promised inheritance to their maddeningly handsome stable boy, Hunter Allen. Now Erin has to win an internship and work late nights at a coffee shop to make her own dreams a reality. She should despise Hunter . . . so why does he sneak into her thoughts as the hero of her latest writing assignment?Then, on the day she's sharing that assignment with her class, Hunter walks in. He's joining her class. And after he reads about himself in her story, her private fantasies about him must be painfully clear.

He is a man who can count all his friends on the fingers of one hand, whose lifelong difficulty with social rituals has convinced him that he is simply not wired for romance. So when an acquaintance informs him that he would make a “wonderful” husband, his first reaction is shock. Yet he must concede to the statistical probability that there is someone for everyone, and he embarks upon The Wife Project. In the orderly, evidence-based manner with which he approaches all things, Don sets out to find the perfect partner. She will be punctual and logical—most definitely not a barmaid, a smoker, a drinker, or a late-arriver.Yet Rosie Jarman is all these things. She is also beguiling, fiery, intelligent—and on a quest of her own. She is looking for her biological father, a search that a certain DNA expert might be able to help her with. Don's Wife Project takes a back burner to the Father Project and an unlikely relationship blooms, forcing the scientifically minded geneticist to confront the spontaneous whirlwind that is Rosie—and the realization that love is not always what looks good on paper.The Rosie Project is a moving and hilarious novel for anyone who has ever tenaciously gone after life or love in the face of overwhelming challenges.|Hardcover||295.0|October 1, 2013|Simon & Schuster||||6441.0063999999975|4.02|4.5|474700|19174.0|13.97|2.54|21.285200000000003|Fiction|Romance|Contemporary|Humor|Chick Lit|Adult|Adult Fiction|Audiobook|Book Club|Australia|0.34677813033927263|0.2299853551379057|0.1059311691481572|0.08664876739077372|0.05571149621674396|0.04289724188430559|0.03636807420063461|0.035635831095923845|0.03313400048816207|0.02690993409812057|299567.75

The Children Act|Ian McEwan|A fiercely intelligent, well-respected High Court judge in London faces a morally ambiguous case while her own marriage crumbles in a novel that will keep readers thoroughly enthralled until the last stunning page.Fiona Maye is a High Court judge in London presiding over cases in family court. She is fiercely intelligent, well respected, and deeply immersed in the nuances of her particular field of law. Often the outcome of a case seems simple from the outside, the course of action to ensure a child's welfare obvious. But the law requires more rigor than mere pragmatism, and Fiona is an expert in considering the sensitivities of culture and religion when handing down her verdicts. But Fiona's professional success belies domestic strife. Her husband, Jack, asks her to consider an open marriage and, after an argument, moves out of their house. His departure leaves her adrift, wondering whether it was not love she had lost so much as a modern form of respectability; whether it was not contempt and ostracism she really fears. She decides to throw herself into her work, especially a complex case involving a seventeen-year-old boy whose parents will not permit a lifesaving blood transfusion because it conflicts with their beliefs as Jehovah's Witnesses. But Jack doesn't leave her thoughts, and the pressure to resolve the case - as well as her crumbling marriage - tests Fiona in ways that will keep readers thoroughly enthralled until the last stunning page.|Hardcover||221.0|September 9, 2014|Nan A.

Ravenous: Otto Warburg, the Nazis, and the Search for the Cancer-Diet Connection|Sam   Apple|The extraordinary story of the Nazi-era scientific genius who discovered how cancer cells eat―and what it means for how we should.The Nobel laureate Otto Warburg―a cousin of the famous finance Warburgs―was widely regarded in his day as one of the most important biochemists of the twentieth century, a man whose research was integral to humanity’s understanding of cancer. He was also among the most despised figures in Nazi Germany. As a Jewish homosexual living openly with his male partner, Warburg represented all that the Third Reich abhorred. Yet Hitler and his top advisors dreaded cancer, and protected Warburg in the hope that he could cure it.In Ravenous, Sam Apple reclaims Otto Warburg as a forgotten, morally compromised genius who pursued cancer single-mindedly even as Europe disintegrated around him. While the vast majority of Jewish scientists fled Germany in the anxious years leading up to World War II, Warburg remained in Berlin, working under the watchful eye of the dictatorship. With the Nazis goose-stepping their way across Europe, systematically rounding up and murdering millions of Jews, Warburg awoke each morning in an elegant, antiques-filled home and rode horses with his partner, Jacob Heiss, before delving into his research at the Kaiser Wilhelm Society.Hitler and other Nazi leaders, Apple shows, were deeply troubled by skyrocketing cancer rates across the Western world, viewing cancer as an existential threat akin to Judaism or homosexuality. Ironically, they viewed Warburg as Germany’s best chance of survival. Setting Warburg’s work against the absorbing history of cancer science, Apple follows him as he arrived at his central belief that cancer is a problem of metabolism. Though Warburg’s metabolic approach to cancer was considered groundbreaking, his work was soon eclipsed in the early postwar era, after the discovery of the structure of DNA set off a search for the genetic origins of cancer.Remarkably, Warburg’s theory has undergone a resurgence in our own time, as scientists have begun to investigate the dangers of sugar and the link between obesity and cancer, finding that the way we eat can influence how cancer cells take up nutrients and grow. Rooting his revelations in extensive archival research as well as dozens of interviews with today’s leading cancer authorities, Apple demonstrates how Warburg’s midcentury work may well hold the secret to why cancer became so common in the modern world and how we can reverse the trend. A tale of scientific discovery, personal peril, and the race to end a disastrous disease, Ravenous would be the stuff of the most inventive fiction were it not, in fact, true.|Hardcover||296.0|May 25, 2021|Liveright||||625.95696|5.0||3||15.748|3.556|23.622000000000003|Nonfiction||||||||||1.0||||||||||353562.13

Breadcrumbs|Anne Ursu|"Once upon a time, Hazel and Jack were best friends. They had been best friends since they were six, spending hot Minneapolis summers and cold Minneapolis winters together, dreaming of Hogwarts and Oz, superheroes and baseball. Now that they were eleven, it was weird for a boy and a girl to be best friends. But they couldn't help it - Hazel and Jack fit, in that way you only read about in books. And they didn't fit anywhere else. And then, one day, it was over. Jack just stopped talking to Hazel. And while her mom tried to tell her that this sometimes happens to boys and girls at this age, Hazel had read enough stories to know that it's never that simple. And it turns out, she was right. Jack's heart had been frozen, and he was taken into the woods by a woman dressed in white to live in a palace made of ice. Now, it's up to Hazel to venture into the woods after him. Hazel finds, however, that these woods are nothing like what she's read about, and the Jack that Hazel went in to save isn't the same Jack that will emerge. Or even the same Hazel.Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Snow Queen,"" Breadcrumbs is a story of the struggle to hold on, and the things we leave behind."|Hardcover||320.0|September 27, 2011|Walden Pond Press|8 - 12 years|720L|3 - 7|6622.4432|3.75|4.4|11740.0|232.0|13.97|2.6670000000000003|20.955|Fantasy|Middle Grade|Fairy Tales|Young Adult|Childrens|Fiction|Adventure|Retellings|Juvenile|Magic|0.3847894975101856|0.19737437754640108|0.08148483476686283|0.08057944771389769|0.06654594839293798|0.05975554549569941|0.04979628791308284|0.03395201448619285|0.02716161158895428|0.018560434585785424|215111.3

The Second Empress: A Novel of Napoleon's Court|Michelle Moran|National bestselling author Michelle Moran returns to Paris, this time under the rule of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte as he casts aside his beautiful wife to marry a Hapsburg princess he hopes will bear him a royal heirAfter the bloody French Revolution, Emperor Napoleon’s power is absolute. When Marie-Louise, the eighteen year old daughter of the King of Austria, is told that the Emperor has demanded her hand in marriage, her father presents her with a terrible choice: marry the cruel, capricious Napoleon, leaving the man she loves and her home forever, or say no, and plunge her country into war.Marie-Louise knows what she must do, and she travels to France, determined to be a good wife despite Napoleon’s reputation. But lavish parties greet her in Paris, and at the extravagant French court, she finds many rivals for her husband’s affection, including Napoleon’s first wife, Joséphine, and his sister Pauline, the only woman as ambitious as the emperor himself. Beloved by some and infamous to many, Pauline is fiercely loyal to her brother. She is also convinced that Napoleon is destined to become the modern Pharaoh of Egypt. Indeed, her greatest hope is to rule alongside him as his queen—a brother-sister marriage just as the ancient Egyptian royals practiced. Determined to see this dream come to pass, Pauline embarks on a campaign to undermine the new empress and convince Napoleon to divorce Marie-Louise.As Pauline's insightful Haitian servant, Paul, watches these two women clash, he is torn between his love for Pauline and his sympathy for Marie-Louise.

Dinner: A Love Story: It All Begins at the Family Table|Jenny Rosenstrach|Jenny Rosenstrach, and her husband, Andy, regularly, some might say pathologically, cook dinner for their family every night. Even when they work long days. Even when their kids' schedules pull them in eighteen different directions. They are not superhuman. They are not from another planet.With simple strategies and common sense, Jenny figured out how to break down dinner—the food, the timing, the anxiety, from prep to cleanup—so that her family could enjoy good food, time to unwind, and simply be together.Using the same straight-up, inspiring voice that readers of her award-winning blog, Dinner: A Love Story, have come to count on, Jenny never judges and never preaches. Every meal she dishes up is a real meal, one that has been cooked and eaten and enjoyed at least a half dozen times by someone in Jenny's house. With inspiration and game plans for any home cook at any level, Dinner: A Love Story is as much for the novice who doesn't know where to start as it is for the gourmand who doesn't know how to start over when she finds herself feeding an intractable toddler or for the person who never thought about home-cooked meals until he or she became a parent. This book is, in fact, for anyone interested in learning how to make a meal to be shared with someone they love, and about how so many good, happy things happen when we do.|Hardcover||302.0|June 5, 2012|Ecco||||1038.72568|4.05|4.7|4653|245.0|2.9972|23.876|18.8468|Cookbooks|Food|Nonfiction|Cooking|Memoir|Parenting|Foodie|Family|Adult|Biography Memoir|0.3560500695410292|0.19888734353268428|0.15299026425591095|0.11543810848400556|0.0737134909596662|0.04867872044506258|0.02086230876216968|0.016689847009735744|0.009735744089012515|0.006954102920723227|238210.5
Joseph Anton: A Memoir|Salman Rushdie|On February 14, 1989, Valentine’s Day, Salman Rushdie received a telephone call from a BBC journalist who told the author that he had been “sentenced to death” by the Ayatollah Khomeini. It was the first time Rushdie heard the word fatwa. His crime? To have written a novel called The Satanic Verses, which was accused of being “against Islam, the Prophet, and the Quran.” So begins the extraordinary story of how a writer was forced underground, moving from house to house, with the constant presence of an armed police protection team. Rushdie was asked to choose an alias that the police could call him by. He thought of writers he loved and various combinations of their names. Then it came to him: Conrad and Chekhov—Joseph Anton. How do a writer and his family live with the threat of murder for more than nine years? How does he go on working? How does he fall in and out of love? How does despair shape his thoughts and actions, and how does he learn to fight back? In this remarkable memoir, Rushdie tells that story for the first time; the story of the crucial battle for freedom of speech. He shares the sometimes grim, sometimes comic realities of living with armed policemen, and the close bonds he formed with his protectors; of his struggle for support and understanding from governments, intelligence chiefs, publishers, journalists, and fellow writers; and of how he regained his freedom. Compelling, provocative, and moving, Joseph Anton is a book of exceptional frankness, honesty, and vital importance. Because what happened to Salman Rushdie was the first act of a drama that is still unfolding somewhere in the world every day.|Hardcover||636.0|September 18, 2012|Random House||||1097.69264|3.6|4.0|8156|417.0|16.51|3.81|24.13|Nonfiction|Memoir|Biography|Biography Memoir|Autobiography|Politics|India|Religion|History|Literature|0.3461538461538461|0.2371794871794872|0.1655982905982906|0.05982905982905984|0.045940170940170943|0.036324786324786335|0.03205128205128205|0.03098290598290598|0.023504273504273504|0.02243589743589744|120982.06

The Daylight War|Peter V. Brett|On the night of the new moon, the demons rise in force, seeking the deaths of two men both of whom have the potential to become the fabled Deliverer, the man prophesied to reunite the scattered remnants of humanity in a final push to destroy the demon corelings once and for all.Arlen Bales was once an ordinary man, but now he has become something more—the Warded Man, tattooed with eldritch wards so powerful they make him a match for any demon. Arlen denies he is the Deliverer at every turn, but the more he tries to be one with the common folk, the more fervently they believe. Many would follow him, but Arlen’s path threatens to lead him to a dark place he alone can travel to, and from which there may be no returning.The only one with hope of keeping Arlen in the world of men, or joining him in his descent into the world of demons, is Renna Tanner, a fierce young woman in danger of losing herself to the power of demon magic.Ahmann Jardir has forged the warlike desert tribes of Krasia into a demon-killing army and proclaimed himself Shar’Dama Ka, the Deliverer. He carries ancient weapons--a spear and a crown--that give credence to his claim, and already vast swaths of the green lands bow to his control.But Jardir did not come to power on his own. His rise was engineered by his First Wife, Inevera, a cunning and powerful priestess whose formidable demon bone magic gives her the ability to glimpse the future. Inevera’s motives and past are shrouded in mystery, and even Jardir does not entirely trust her.Once Arlen and Jardir were as close as brothers. Now they are the bitterest of rivals. As humanity’s enemies rise, the only two men capable of defeating them are divided against each other by the most deadly demons of all--those lurking in the human heart.|Hardcover||639.0|February 12, 2013|Del Rey||||907.184|4.21|4.4|54971|1922.0|16.433799999999998|4.4196|24.3332|Fantasy|Epic Fantasy|Fiction|High Fantasy|Magic|Demons|Audiobook|Dark Fantasy|Science Fiction Fantasy|Adventure|0.7594123048668503|0.059381695745332114|0.05203550658096113|0.02969084787266605|0.02785430058157331|0.016835016835016838|0.014386287113559841|0.014386287113559841|0.013161922252831344|0.01285583103764922|257989.19

The Dovekeepers|Alice Hoffman|Over five years in the writing, The Dovekeepers is Alice Hoffman's most ambitious and mesmerizing novel, a tour de force of imagination and research, set in ancient Israel.In 70 C.E., nine hundred Jews held out for months against armies of Romans on Masada, a mountain in the Judean desert. According to the ancient historian Josephus, two women and five children survived. Based on this tragic and iconic event, Hoffman's novel is a spellbinding tale of four extraordinarily bold, resourceful, and sensuous women, each of whom has come to Masada by a different path. Yael's mother died in childbirth, and her father, an expert assassin, never forgave her for that death. Revka, a village baker's wife, watched the horrifically brutal murder of her daughter by Roman soldiers; she brings to Masada her young grandsons, rendered mute by what they have witnessed. Aziza is a warrior's daughter, raised as a boy, a fearless rider and an expert marksman who finds passion with a fellow soldier.

Hysteria|Stephanie M. Wytovich|Asylums once used to confine those deemed mentally unfit linger, forgotten behind trees or urban development, beautiful yet desolate in their decay. Within them festers something far more unnerving than unlit corners or unexplained noises: the case files left to moulder out of sight, out of conscience. Stephanie M. Wytovich forces your hands upon these crumbling, warped binders and exposes your mind to every taboo misfortune experienced by the outcast, exiled, misbegotten monsters and victims who have walked among us. The poetry contained in Hysteria performs internal body modification on its readers in an unrelenting fashion, employing broad-spectrum brutality treatment that spans the physical to the societal, as noted in Stoker Award winner Michael A.

The Fallen Angel|Daniel Silva|"After narrowly surviving his last operation, Gabriel Allon, the wayward son of Israeli intelligence, has taken refuge behind the walls of the Vatican, where he is restoring one of Caravaggio's greatest masterpieces. But early one morning he is summoned to St. Peter's Basilica by Monsignor Luigi Donati, the all-powerful private secretary to his Holiness Pope Paul VII; the body of a beautiful woman lies broken beneath Michelangelo's magnificent dome. The Vatican police suspect suicide, though Gabriel believes otherwise. So, it seems, does Donati. But the monsignor is fearful that a public inquiry might inflict another scandal on the Church, and so he calls upon Gabriel to quietly pursue the truth—with one caveat.""Rule number one at the Vatican,"" Donati said. ""Don't ask too many questions.""Gabriel learns that the dead woman had uncovered a dangerous secret—a secret that threatens a global criminal enterprise that is looting timeless treasures of antiquity and selling them to the highest bidder. But there is more to this network than just greed. A mysterious operative is plotting an act of sabotage that will plunge the world into a conflict of apocalyptic proportions . . ."|Hardcover|First Edition (U.S.)|406.0|July 17, 2012|Harper||||544.3104|4.2|4.5|23605.0|2782.0|15.24|3.2766|22.86|Fiction|Thriller|Mystery|Espionage|Mystery Thriller|Suspense|Spy Thriller|Audiobook|Crime|Action|0.2634730538922156|0.24311377245508986|0.16047904191616766|0.09580838323353294|0.06467065868263472|0.04790419161676647|0.0407185628742515|0.033532934131736525|0.0251497005988024|0.0251497005988024|334794.03
Dangerous God: A Defense of Transcendent Truth|Albert Norton|Why is the world so crazy? Why have we lost the ability to agree on fundamental truths? Everyone seems to be running toward something, but could it be that we are running away from something greater? In Dangerous God: A Defense of Transcendent Truth, Albert Norton makes the case that confronting the reality of God in the postmodern world is a dangerous proposition. Dangerous to our most cherished notions of reality. Dangerous to our comfortable worldview and how we see ourselves. To find out why this postmodern turn has come to pass, Norton insists we must ask ourselves Pilate’s age-old question: What is truth?It could be that in the postmodern age we don’t merely disagree about whether something is true, but that we disagree about how truth and values are formed in the first place. To begin to understand this, we really must start with how we think and form value judgments in general. We share an orientation to objective truth, in our thinking, and we build on rational processes of binary differentiation. This should lead us to an objective and real hierarchy of ideals, rather than a subjective or socially-produced narrative.To understand this, a history of truth formation is presented, distinguishing the medieval to modern periods, and then the modern to postmodern, highlighting the thinking of Descartes, Rousseau, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Marx, Nietzsche, William James, and John Dewey, among many others. This leads to a discussion of truth at the hands of postmodernists such as Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Richard Rorty. The purpose is to trace the intellectual movements shaping the determination of truth and values, from individualism to collectivism, correspondence theory to pragmatism, anxiety about meaning as expressed in existentialism, and Marxism re-worked for cultural application—the “woke” movement.The author concludes: Truth exists as a real and extant feature of the universe. It is objective and unchanging and “out there.” It resides in and emanates from and is personified in God, the ideal of the ideals; the pinnacle of the hierarchy of values that we perceive, rather than create.|Kindle Edition||232.0|May 24, 2021|New English Review Press|||||0.0||0|||||||||||||||||||||||||144225.63

The School for Good and Evil|Soman Chainani|The first kidnappings happened two hundred years before. Some years it was two boys taken, some years two girls, sometimes one of each. But if at first the choices seemed random, soon the pattern became clear. One was always beautiful and good, the child every parent wanted as their own. The other was homely and odd, an outcast from birth. An opposing pair, plucked from youth and spirited away.This year, best friends Sophie and Agatha are about to discover where all the lost children go: the fabled School for Good & Evil, where ordinary boys and girls are trained to be fairy tale heroes and villains. As the most beautiful girl in Gavaldon, Sophie has dreamed of being kidnapped into an enchanted world her whole life. With her pink dresses, glass slippers, and devotion to good deeds, she knows she’ll earn top marks at the School for Good and graduate a storybook princess. Meanwhile Agatha, with her shapeless black frocks, wicked pet cat, and dislike of nearly everyone, seems a natural fit for the School for Evil.But when the two girls are swept into the Endless Woods, they find their fortunes reversed—Sophie’s dumped in the School for Evil to take Uglification, Death Curses, and Henchmen Training, while Agatha finds herself in the School For Good, thrust amongst handsome princes and fair maidens for classes in Princess Etiquette and Animal Communication.. But what if the mistake is actually the first clue to discovering who Sophie and Agatha really are…?The School for Good & Evil is an epic journey into a dazzling new world, where the only way out of a fairy tale is to live through one.|Hardcover||488.0|May 14, 2013|HarperCollins|8 - 12 years|830L|3 - 7|544.3104|4.02|4.5|71109.0|1235.0|13.97|3.7846|20.955|Fantasy|Middle Grade|Young Adult|Magic|Fairy Tales|Fiction|Romance|Childrens|Adventure|Audiobook|0.4455873583780561|0.1759093619558736|0.1124031007751938|0.05128205128205128|0.05023852116875373|0.045915324985092425|0.0424865831842576|0.03413834227787716|0.02549194991055456|0.016547406082289804|227382.75

Crazy River: Exploration and Folly in East Africa|Richard Grant|From the acclaimed author of Dispatches From Pluto and Deepest South of All comes a rollicking travelogue from East Africa.NO ONE TRAVELS QUITE LIKE RICHARD GRANT and, really, no one should. In his last book, the adventure classic God’s Middle Finger, he narrowly escaped death in Mexico’s lawless Sierra Madre. Now, Grant has plunged with his trademark recklessness, wit, and curiosity into East Africa. Setting out to make the first descent of an unexplored river in Tanzania, he gets waylaid in Zanzibar by thieves, whores, and a charismatic former golf pro before crossing the Indian Ocean in a rickety cargo boat. And then the real adventure begins. Known to local tribes as “the river of bad spirits,” the Malagarasi River is a daunting adversary even with a heavily armed Tanzanian crew as travel companions. Dodging bullets, hippos, and crocodiles, Grant finally emerges in war-torn Burundi, where he befriends some ethnic street gangsters and trails a notorious man-eating crocodile known as Gustave. He concludes his journey by interviewing the dictatorial president of Rwanda and visiting the true source of the Nile. Gripping, illuminating, sometimes harrowing, often hilarious, Crazy River is a brilliantly rendered account of a modern-day exploration of Africa, and the unraveling of Grant’s peeled, battered mind as he tries to take it all in.|Paperback||323.0|October 25, 2011|Free Press||||4989.512|4.06|4.4|671.0|127.0|13.97|2.54|21.4376|Travel|Nonfiction|Africa|Adventure|History|Tanzania|World History||||0.35526315789473684|0.25|0.2368421052631579|0.06578947368421052|0.03947368421052632|0.02631578947368421|0.02631578947368421||||112608.6

One Summer: America, 1927|Bill Bryson|In One Summer Bill Bryson, one of our greatest and most beloved nonfiction writers, transports readers on a journey back to one amazing season in American life.The summer of 1927 began with one of the signature events of the twentieth century: on May 21, 1927, Charles Lindbergh became the first man to cross the Atlantic by plane nonstop, and when he landed in Le Bourget airfield near Paris, he ignited an explosion of worldwide rapture and instantly became the most famous person on the planet. Meanwhile, the titanically talented Babe Ruth was beginning his assault on the home run record, which would culminate on September 30 with his sixtieth blast, one of the most resonant and durable records in sports history. In between those dates a Queens housewife named Ruth Snyder and her corset-salesman lover garroted her husband, leading to a murder trial that became a huge tabloid sensation. Alvin “Shipwreck” Kelly sat atop a flagpole in Newark, New Jersey, for twelve days—a new record. The American South was clobbered by unprecedented rain and by flooding of the Mississippi basin, a great human disaster, the relief efforts for which were guided by the uncannily able and insufferably pompous Herbert Hoover. Calvin Coolidge interrupted an already leisurely presidency for an even more relaxing three-month vacation in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The gangster Al Capone tightened his grip on the illegal booze business through a gaudy and murderous reign of terror and municipal corruption. The first true “talking picture,” Al Jolson’s The Jazz Singer, was filmed and forever changed the motion picture industry. The four most powerful central bankers on earth met in secret session on a Long Island estate and made a fateful decision that virtually guaranteed a future crash and depression.     All this and much, much more transpired in that epochal summer of 1927, and Bill Bryson captures its outsized personalities, exciting events, and occasional just plain weirdness with his trademark vividness, eye for telling detail, and delicious humor. In that year America stepped out onto the world stage as the main event, and One Summer transforms it all into narrative nonfiction of the highest order.|Hardcover||456.0|October 1, 2013|Doubleday||||1360.7759999999996|4.07|4.6|46894.0|4208.0|16.383|3.4544|24.1808|History|Nonfiction|American History|Audiobook|Historical|Biography|Humor|Baseball|American|Adult|0.4123840561544247|0.3983454499874655|0.05114063675106543|0.04637753823013287|0.03108548508398095|0.014289295562797694|0.012534469791927802|0.012283780396089246|0.011030333416896463|0.010528954625219356|518288.3

When his captors discover that he speaks several languages, he is put to work as a Tätowierer (the German word for tattooist), tasked with permanently marking his fellow prisoners.Imprisoned for over two and a half years, Lale witnesses horrific atrocities and barbarism—but also incredible acts of bravery and compassion. Risking his own life, he uses his privileged position to exchange jewels and money from murdered Jews for food to keep his fellow prisoners alive.One day in July 1942, Lale, prisoner 32407, comforts a trembling young woman waiting in line to have the number 34902 tattooed onto her arm. Her name is Gita, and in that first encounter, Lale vows to somehow survive the camp and marry her.A vivid, harrowing, and ultimately hopeful re-creation of Lale Sokolov's experiences as the man who tattooed the arms of thousands of prisoners with what would become one of the most potent symbols of the Holocaust, The Tattooist of Auschwitz is also a testament to the endurance of love and humanity under the darkest possible conditions.|Paperback||272.0|||||||4.25|4.7|556393.0|40563.0||||Historical Fiction|Fiction|Historical|Audiobook|World War II|Holocaust|War|Romance|Adult|Adult Fiction|0.4315823870598807|0.1796421860959072|0.08651253982517768|0.059799036026468425|0.055551017073768486|0.052773466220080056|0.04672820847969937|0.04395065762601095|0.02630504043787272|0.017155461155134385|128633.67
The Measure of the Magic|Terry Brooks|NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER   For five hundred years, the survivors of the Great Wars lived peacefully in a valley sanctuary shielded by powerful magic from the dangerous outside world. But the enchanted barriers have crumbled, and the threat of annihilation looms large once more. As he lay dying, Sider Ament, bearer of the last black staff and protector of the valley, gave stewardship of the powerful talisman to the young Tracker Panterra Qu. Now the newly anointed Knight of the Word must take up the battle against evil wherever it threatens: from without, where an army of bloodthirsty Trolls is massing for invasion; and from within, where the Elf king of Arborlon has been murdered, his daughter stands accused, and a heinous conspiracy is poised to subjugate the kingdom. But even these affairs will pale beside the most harrowing menace Panterra is destined to confront—a nameless, merciless agent of darkness on a relentless mission: to claim the last black staff . . . and the life of whoever wields it.BONUS: This edition includes an excerpt from Terry Brooks's The Wards of Faerie.|Hardcover||383.0|August 23, 2011|Del Rey||880L||566.99|4.04|4.7|7932.0|703.0|16.7894|3.5814|24.28240000000001|Fantasy|Fiction|Epic Fantasy|High Fantasy|Magic|Science Fiction Fantasy|Adventure|Epic|Science Fiction|Adult|0.5807228915662651|0.13012048192771086|0.06987951807228916|0.04096385542168675|0.03855421686746988|0.03614457831325301|0.03614457831325301|0.02650602409638554|0.02650602409638554|0.014457831325301203|646633.23
2030: The Real Story of What Happens to America|Albert Brooks|Is this what’s in store?June 12, 2030 started out like any other day in memory—and by then, memories were long.  Since cancer had been cured fifteen years before, America’s population was aging rapidly.  That sounds like good news, but consider this: millions of baby boomers, with a big natural predator picked off, were sucking dry benefits and resources that were never meant to hold them into their eighties and beyond.  Young people around the country simmered with resentment toward “the olds” and anger at the treadmill they could never get off of just to maintain their parents’ entitlement programs.But on that June 12th, everything changed: a massive earthquake devastated Los Angeles, and the government, always teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, was unable to respond. The fallout from the earthquake sets in motion a sweeping novel of ideas that pits national hope for the future against assurances from the past and is peopled by a memorable cast of refugees and billionaires, presidents and revolutionaries, all struggling to find their way.  In 2030, the author’s all-too-believable imagining of where today’s challenges could lead us tomorrow makes gripping and thought-provoking reading.|Hardcover||375.0|May 10, 2011|St. Martin's Press||||589.6696|3.48|3.8|5389.0|563.0|16.459200000000006|3.7592|24.1808|Fiction|Science Fiction|Humor|Dystopia|Politics|Speculative Fiction|Comedy|Science Fiction Fantasy|Adult Fiction|Contemporary|0.448|0.17333333333333334|0.09866666666666668|0.08533333333333333|0.05333333333333334|0.042666666666666665|0.034666666666666665|0.021333333333333333|0.021333333333333333|0.021333333333333333|198941.86

The Black Count: Glory, Revolution, Betrayal, and the Real Count of Monte Cristo|Tom Reiss|Here is the remarkable true story of the real Count of Monte Cristo – a stunning feat of historical sleuthing that brings to life the forgotten hero who inspired such classics as  The Count of Monte Cristo  and  The Three Musketeers. The real-life protagonist of The Black Count, General Alex Dumas, is a man almost unknown today yet with a story that is strikingly familiar, because his son, the novelist Alexandre Dumas, used it to create some of the best loved heroes of literature.Yet, hidden behind these swashbuckling adventures was an even more incredible secret: the real hero was the son of a black slave -- who rose higher in the white world than any man of his race would before our own time.  Born in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), Alex Dumas was briefly sold into bondage but made his way to Paris where he was schooled as a sword-fighting member of the French aristocracy. Enlisting as a private, he rose to command armies at the height of the Revolution in an audacious campaign across Europe and the Middle East – until he met an implacable enemy he could not defeat.The Black Count is simultaneously a riveting adventure story, a lushly textured evocation of 18th-century France, and a window into the modern world’s first multi-racial society. But it is also a heartbreaking story of the enduring bonds of love between a father and son.|Hardcover||414.0|September 18, 2012|Crown||||771.1064|3.95|4.6|17508|1184.0|16.891000000000002|3.3528|24.2316|History|Nonfiction|Biography|France|Historical|Biography Memoir|War|Audiobook|Adventure|European History|0.3412436167017122|0.2655452087714028|0.2349053769900871|0.040552718534094326|0.03484529888855512|0.025533193151096426|0.018323820967257442|0.013817963352358064|0.013517572844698109|0.011715229798738359|856402.84
A Feast of Ice and Fire: The Official Companion Cookbook|Chelsea Monroe-Cassel|Ever wonder what it’s like to attend a feast at Winterfell? Wish you could split a lemon cake with Sansa Stark, scarf down a pork pie with the Night’s Watch, or indulge in honeyfingers with Daenerys Targaryen? George R. R. Martin’s bestselling saga A Song of Ice and Fire and the runaway hit HBO series Game of Thrones are renowned for bringing Westeros’s sights and sounds to vivid life. But one important ingredient has always been missing: the mouthwatering dishes that form the backdrop of this extraordinary world. Now, fresh out of the series that redefined fantasy, comes the cookbook that may just redefine dinner . . . and lunch, and breakfast.  A passion project from superfans and amateur chefs Chelsea Monroe-Cassel and Sariann Lehrer—and endorsed by George R. R. Martin himself—A Feast of Ice and Fire lovingly replicates a stunning range of cuisines from across the Seven Kingdoms and beyond.

These easy-to-follow recipes have been refined for modern cooking techniques, but adventurous eaters can also attempt the authentic medieval meals that inspired them. The authors have also suggested substitutions for some of the more fantastical ingredients, so you won’t have to stock your kitchen with camel, live doves, or dragon eggs to create meals fit for a king (or a khaleesi). In all, A Feast of Ice and Fire contains more than 100 recipes, divided by region: • The Wall: Rack of Lamb and Herbs; Pork Pie; Mutton in Onion-Ale Broth; Mulled Wine; Pease Porridge• The North: Beef and Bacon Pie; Honeyed Chicken; Aurochs with Roasted Leeks; Baked Apples• The South: Cream Swans; Trout Wrapped in Bacon; Stewed Rabbit; Sister’s Stew; Blueberry Tarts• King’s Landing: Lemon Cakes; Quails Drowned in Butter; Almond Crusted Trout; Bowls of Brown; Iced Milk with Honey• Dorne: Stuffed Grape Leaves; Duck with Lemons; Chickpea Paste• Across the Narrow Sea: Biscuits and Bacon; Tyroshi Honeyfingers; Wintercakes; Honey-Spiced Locusts There’s even a guide to dining and entertaining in the style of the Seven Kingdoms. Exhaustively researched and reverently detailed, accompanied by passages from all five books in the series and full-color photographs guaranteed to whet your appetite, this is the companion to the blockbuster phenomenon that millions of stomachs have been growling for. And remember, winter is coming—so don’t be afraid to put on a few pounds.Includes a Foreword by George R. R.

And the Mountains Echoed|Khaled Hosseini|So, then. You want a story and I will tell you one...Afghanistan, 1952. Abdullah and his sister Pari live with their father and stepmother in the small village of Shadbagh. Their father, Saboor, is constantly in search of work and they struggle together through poverty and brutal winters. To Abdullah, Pari - as beautiful and sweet-natured as the fairy for which she was named - is everything. More like a parent than a brother, Abdullah will do anything for her, even trading his only pair of shoes for a feather for her treasured collection. Each night they sleep together in their cot, their heads touching, their limbs tangled. One day the siblings journey across the desert to Kabul with their father. Pari and Abdullah have no sense of the fate that awaits them there, for the event which unfolds will tear their lives apart; sometimes a finger must be cut to save the hand. Crossing generations and continents, moving from Kabul, to Paris, to San Francisco, to the Greek island of Tinos, with profound wisdom, depth, insight and compassion, Khaled Hosseini writes about the bonds that define us and shape our lives, the ways in which we help our loved ones in need, how the choices we make resonate through history and how we are often surprised by the people closest to us.|Hardcover||404.0|May 21, 2013|Riverhead Books||||725.7472|4.05|4.3|318093|13948.0|16.51|3.4798000000000004|24.13|Fiction|Historical Fiction|Contemporary|Novels|Adult|Adult Fiction|Book Club|Literary Fiction|Historical|Drama|0.5099219050057611|0.20419920624759955|0.06542056074766353|0.03507873511714249|0.034310587632825504|0.03354244014850851|0.03162207143771604|0.03149404685699654|0.029573678146204083|0.02483676865958264|210635.83

Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief|Lawrence Wright|"A clear-sighted revelation, a deep penetration into the world of Scientology by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the now-classic study of al-Qaeda's 9/11 attack, the Looming Tower. Based on more than two hundred personal interviews with both current and former Scientologists--both famous and less well known--and years of archival research, Lawrence Wright uses his extraordinary investigative skills to uncover for us the inner workings of the Church of Scientology: its origins in the imagination of science-fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard; its struggles to find acceptance as a legitimate (and legally acknowledged) religion; its vast, secret campaign to infiltrate the U.S. government; and its dramatic efforts to grow and prevail after the death of Hubbard.At the book's center, two men whom Wright brings vividly to life, showing how they have made Scientology what it is today: The darkly brilliant L. Ron Hubbard--whose restless, expansive mind invented a new religion tailor-made to prosper in the spiritually troubled post-World War II era. And his successor, David Miscavige--tough and driven, with the unenviable task of preserving the church in the face of ongoing scandals and continual legal assaults.We learn about Scientology's esoteric cosmology; about the auditing process that determines an inductee's state of being; about the Bridge to Total Freedom, through which members gain eternal life. We see the ways in which the church pursues celebrities, such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta, and how young idealists who joined the Sea Org, the church's clergy, whose members often enter as children, signing up with a billion-year contract and working with little pay in poor conditions. We meet men and women ""disconnected"" from friends and family by the church's policy of shunning critical voices. And we discover, through many firsthand stories, the violence that has long permeated the inner sanctum of the church.In Going Clear, Wright examines what fundamentally makes a religion a religion, and whether Scientology is, in fact, deserving of the constitutional protections achieved in its victory over the IRS. Employing all his exceptional journalistic skills of observations, understanding, and synthesis, and his ability to shape a story into a compelling narrative, Lawrence Wright has given us an evenhanded yet keenly incisive book that goes far beyond an immediate exposé and uncovers the very essence of what makes Scientology the institution it is."|Hardcover|First Edition|430.0|January 17, 2013|Knopf||||784.71416|4.03|4.4|40352.0|2001.0|16.6878|3.5306|24.1046|Nonfiction|Religion|History|Audiobook|Cults|Biography|Psychology|Journalism|True Crime|Sociology|0.5152487961476726|0.20786516853932585|0.0949705724986624|0.044141252006420544|0.0377207062600321|0.027822364901016583|0.02113429641519529|0.02086677367576244|0.016586409844836808|0.013643659711075442|397306.24

Dream Team: How Michael, Magic, Larry, Charles, and the Greatest Team of All Time Conquered the World and Changed the Game of Basketball Forever|Jack McCallum|They were the Beatles of basketball, the Mercury Seven in sneakers.    In Dream Team, acclaimed sports journalist Jack McCallum delivers the untold story of the greatest team ever assembled: the 1992 U.S. Olympic Men’s Basketball Team that captivated the world, kindled the hoop dreams of countless children around the planet, and remade the NBA into a global sensation.   As a senior staff writer for Sports Illustrated, McCallum enjoyed a courtside seat for the most exciting basketball spectacle on earth, covering the Dream Team from its inception to the gold medal ceremony in Barcelona. For the duration of the Olympics, he lived with, golfed with, and—most important—drank with some of the greatest players of the NBA’s Golden Age: Magic Johnson, the ebullient showman who shrugged off his recent diagnosis of HIV to become the team’s unquestioned captain and leader; Michael Jordan, the transcendent talent at the height of his powers as a player—and a marketing juggernaut; and Charles Barkley, the outspoken iconoclast whose utterances on and off the court threatened to ignite an international incident. Presiding over the entire traveling circus was the Dream Team’s beloved coach, Chuck Daly, whose laissez-faire approach proved instrumental in getting the most out of such disparate personalities and superstars such as Larry Bird, Patrick Ewing, and Scottie Pippen.   Drawing on fresh interviews with the players, McCallum provides the definitive account of the Dream Team phenomenon. He offers a behind-the-scenes look at the controversial selection process. He takes us inside the team’s Olympic suites for late-night card games and bull sessions where the players debate both the finer points of basketball and their respective places in the NBA pantheon. And he narrates a riveting possession-by-possession account of the legendary July 1992 intrasquad scrimmage that pitted the Dream Teamers against one another in what may have been the greatest pickup game—and the greatest exhibition of trash talk—in history.   In the twenty years since the Dream Team first captivated the world’s attention, its mystique has only grown—and so has its influence. The NBA is now flush with international stars, many of them inspired by the exuberant spirit of ’92. Dream Team vividly re-creates the moment when a once-in-a-millennium group of athletes came together, outperformed the hype, and changed the future of sports—one perfectly executed fast break at a time.  The Dream Team was . . .  Michael Jordan, Guard, Chicago Bulls Magic Johnson, Guard, Los Angeles Lakers Larry Bird, Forward, Boston Celtics Charles Barkley, Forward, Phoenix Suns Chris Mullin, Forward, Golden State Warriors Scottie Pippen, Forward, Chicago Bulls John Stockton, Guard, Utah Jazz Karl Malone, Forward, Utah Jazz David Robinson, Center, San Antonio Spurs Patrick Ewing, Center, New York Knicks Christian Laettner, Forward, Duke University Clyde Drexler, Guard, Portland Trailblazers|Hardcover||352.0|July 10, 2012|Ballantine Books||||635.0287999999998|4.2|4.6|11364|489.0|16.154400000000006|2.8194000000000004|24.460200000000004|Sports|Nonfiction|Basketball|History|Biography|Audiobook|Biography Memoir|Contemporary|American History|Pop Culture|0.5583333333333333|0.19333333333333333|0.15166666666666667|0.04|0.03|0.01|0.006666666666666667|0.0033333333333333327|0.0033333333333333327|0.0033333333333333327|476276.63

Lost Lake|Sarah Addison Allen|From the author of the beloved bestseller Garden Spells comes a beautiful, haunting story of old loves and new, and the power of the connections that bind us forever... The first time Eby Pim saw Lost Lake, it was on a picture postcard. Just an old photo and a few words on a small square of heavy stock, but when she saw it, she knew she was seeing her future. That was half a life ago. Now Lost Lake is about to slip into Eby's past. Her husband George is long passed. Most of her demanding extended family are gone. All that's left is a once-charming collection of lakeside cabins succumbing to the Southern Georgia heat and damp, and an assortment of faithful misfits drawn back to Lost Lake year after year by their own unspoken dreams and desires. It's a lot, but not enough to keep Eby from relinquishing Lost Lake to a developer with cash in hand, and calling this her final summer at the lake. Until one last chance at family knocks on her door. Lost Lake is where Kate Pheris spent her last best summer at the age of twelve, before she learned of loneliness, and heartbreak, and loss. Now she's all too familiar with those things, but she knows about hope too, thanks to her resilient daughter Devin, and her own willingness to start moving forward. Perhaps at Lost Lake her little girl can cling to her own childhood for just a little longer... and maybe Kate herself can rediscover something that slipped through her fingers so long ago. One after another, people find their way to Lost Lake, looking for something that they weren't sure they needed in the first place: love, closure, a second chance, peace, a mystery solved, a heart mended. Can they find what they need before it's too late?  At once atmospheric and enchanting, Lost Lake shows Sarah Addison Allen at her finest, illuminating the secret longings and the everyday magic that wait to be discovered in the unlikeliest of places.|Hardcover||304.0|January 21, 2014|St. Martin's Press||||498.9512|3.87|4.6|32723.0|1122.0|16.3322|2.6416|24.0792|Fiction|Magical Realism|Fantasy|Romance|Chick Lit|Contemporary|Adult|Adult Fiction|Southern|Magic|0.2728360590347028|0.2285600319106502|0.10769844435580377|0.10690067810131633|0.09812524930195453|0.05903470283207021|0.03510171519744715|0.033506182688472275|0.03071400079776625|0.027522935779816515|238066.13

Still Foolin' 'Em: Where I've Been, Where I'm Going, and Where the Hell Are My Keys|Billy Crystal|"Hilarious and heartfelt observations on aging from one of America's favorite comedians as he turns 65, and a look back at a remarkable careerBilly Crystal is turning 65, and he's not happy about it. With his trademark wit and heart, he outlines the absurdities and challenges that come with growing old, from insomnia to memory loss to leaving dinners with half your meal on your shirt. In humorous chapters like ""Buying the Plot"" and ""Nodding Off,"" Crystal not only catalogues his physical gripes, but offers a road map to his 77 million fellow baby boomers who are arriving at this milestone age with him. He also looks back at the most powerful and memorable moments of his long and storied life, from entertaining his relatives as a kid in Long Beach, Long Island, his years doing stand-up in the Village, up through his legendary stint at Saturday Night Live, When Harry Met Sally, and his long run as host of the Academy Awards. Readers get a front-row seat to his one-day career with the New York Yankees (he was the first player to ever ""test positive for Maalox""), his love affair with Sophia Loren, and his enduring friendships with several of his idols, including Mickey Mantle and Muhammad Ali. He lends a light touch to more serious topics like religion (""the aging friends I know have turned to the Holy Trinity: Advil, bourbon, and Prozac""), grandparenting, and, of course, dentistry. As wise and poignant as they are funny, Crystal's reflections are an unforgettable look at an extraordinary life well lived."|Hardcover||288.0|September 10, 2013|Henry Holt and Co.||||512.55896|3.91|4.5|14411.0|2189.0|16.4084|2.54|24.460200000000004|Nonfiction|Humor|Biography|Memoir|Audiobook|Autobiography|Comedy|Biography Memoir|Adult|Media Tie In|0.22854914196567866|0.1833073322932917|0.15834633385335414|0.1544461778471139|0.12324492979719187|0.049141965678627136|0.046021840873634944|0.031201248049921998|0.0218408736349454|0.0039001560062402493|71463.15000000001

Celebrity in Death|J.D. Robb|In this thriller in the #1 New York Times bestselling In Death series, Lieutenant Eve Dallas must solve the murder of an actress whose final role was to die for... Lieutenant Eve Dallas is no party girl, but she’s managing to have a reasonably good time at the celebrity-packed bash celebrating The Icove Agenda, a film based on one of her famous cases. It’s a little spooky seeing the actress playing her, who looks as though she could be her long-lost twin. Not as unsettling, though, as seeing the actress who plays Peabody—drowned in the lap pool on the roof of the director’s luxury building. Talented but rude and widely disliked, K.T. Harris made an embarrassing scene during dinner. Now she’s at the center of a crime scene—and Eve is more than ready to get out of her high heels and strap on her holster to step into the role she was born to play: cop.|Hardcover||389.0|February 21, 2012|Putnam Adult|18 years and up|||589.6696|4.3|4.7|23168.0|1899.0|16.128999999999998|3.3274000000000004|23.5712|Mystery|Romance|Crime|Fiction|Romantic Suspense|Futuristic|Suspense|Science Fiction|Audiobook|Thriller|0.35920177383592017|0.15521064301552107|0.08481152993348115|0.08425720620842572|0.07206208425720621|0.07039911308203993|0.057649667405764965|0.04711751662971175|0.03547671840354767|0.033813747228381374|173244.0
22 Britannia Road|Amanda Hodgkinson|"A tour de force that echoes modern classics like Suite Francaise and The Postmistress.   ""Housekeeper or housewife?"" the soldier asks Silvana as she and eight- year-old Aurek board the ship that will take them from Poland to England at the end of World War II. There her husband, Janusz, is already waiting for them at the little house at 22 Britannia Road. But the war has changed them all so utterly that they'll barely recognize one another when they are reunited. ""Survivor,"" she answers.  Silvana and Aurek spent the war hiding in the forests of Poland. Wild, almost feral Aurek doesn't know how to tie his own shoes or sleep in a bed. Janusz is an Englishman now-determined to forget Poland, forget his own ghosts from the way, and begin a new life as a proper English family. But for Silvana, who cannot escape the painful memory of a shattering wartime act, forgetting is not a possibility.  One of the most searing debuts to come along in years, 22 Britannia Road is the wrenching chronicle of how these damaged people try to become, once again, a true family. An unforgettable novel that cries out for discussion, it is a powerful story of primal maternal love, overcoming hardship, and, ultimately, acceptance-one that will pierce your heart."|Hardcover||323.0|April 28, 2011|Pamela Dorman Books||||6168.8512|3.64|4.1|11244.0|322.0|15.875|3.81|23.495|Historical Fiction|Fiction|World War II|Historical|War|British Literature|Poland|Audiobook|Holocaust|Family|0.4387990762124711|0.20785219399538107|0.08429561200923788|0.06581986143187067|0.053117782909930716|0.04734411085450346|0.03695150115473441|0.02771362586605081|0.020785219399538105|0.017321016166281754|259288.52

In the midst of this brewing rebellion a series of brutal supernatural murders strikes at the heart of the Kingdoms. It is up to a handful of heroes to learn the truth behind these killings:Doctor Adoulla Makhslood, “the last real ghul hunter in the great city of Dhamsawaat,” just wants a quiet cup of tea. Three score and more years old, he has grown weary of hunting monsters and saving lives, and is more than ready to retire from his dangerous and demanding vocation. But when an old flame’s family is murdered, Adoulla is drawn back to the hunter’s path.Raseed bas Raseed, Adoulla’s young assistant, is a hidebound holy warrior whose prowess is matched only by his piety. But even as Raseed’s sword is tested by ghuls and manjackals, his soul is tested when he and Adoulla cross paths with the tribeswoman Zamia.Zamia Badawi, Protector of the Band, has been gifted with the near-mythical power of the lion-shape, but shunned by her people for daring to take up a man’s title. She lives only to avenge her father’s death. Until she learns that Adoulla and his allies also hunt her father’s killer. Until she meets Raseed.When they learn that the murders and the Falcon Prince’s brewing revolution are connected, the companions must race against time—and struggle against their own misgivings—to save the life of a vicious despot.

Detroit: An American Autopsy|Charlie LeDuff|In the heart of America, a metropolis is quietly destroying itself. Detroit, once the richest city in the nation, is now its poorest. Once the vanguard of America’s machine age—mass production, automobiles, and blue-collar jobs—Detroit is now America’s capital for unemployment, illiteracy, foreclosure, and dropouts. A city the size of San Francisco and Manhattan could neatly fit into Detroit’s vacant lots. In another life, Charlie LeDuff won the Pulitzer Prize reporting for The New York Times. But all that is behind him now, after returning to find his hometown in total freefall. Detroit is where his mother’s flower shop was firebombed; where his sister lost herself to drugs; where his brother works in a factory cleaning Chinese-manufactured screws so they can be repackaged as “Made in America.” With the steel-eyed reportage that has become his trademark—and the righteous indignation only a native son possesses—LeDuff sets out to uncover what destroyed his city. He embeds with a local fire brigade struggling to defend its neighborhood against systemic arson and bureaucratic corruption. He investigates state senators and career police officials, following the money to discover who benefits from Detroit’s decline. He befriends union organizers, homeless do-gooders, embattled businessmen, and struggling homeowners, all ordinary people holding the city together by sheer determination. Americans have hoped for decades that Detroit was an exception, an outlier. What LeDuff reveals is that Detroit is, once and for all, America’s city: It led us on the way up, and now it is leading us on the way down. Detroit can no longer be ignored because what happened there is happening out here. Redemption is thin on the ground in this ghost of a city, but Detroit: An American Autopsy is no hopeless parable. Instead, LeDuff shares a deeply human drama of colossal greed, ignorance, endurance, and courage. Detroit is an unbelievable story of a hard town in a rough time filled with some of the strangest and strongest people our country has to offer—and a black comic tale of the absurdity of American life in the twenty-first century.|Hardcover|First Edition (U.S.)|304.0|February 7, 2013|Penguin Press||||680.3879999999998|3.94|4.6|14153.0|1264.0|16.51|3.81|22.86|Nonfiction|History|Memoir|Politics|Sociology|Journalism|Audiobook|Biography|American History|The United States Of America|0.4950738916256158|0.18719211822660092|0.0755336617405583|0.06568144499178982|0.03694581280788178|0.0361247947454844|0.03284072249589491|0.029556650246305417|0.02134646962233169|0.019704433497536943|286430.08

But is Eliza Bright a brilliant, self-taught coder bravely calling out the toxic masculinity and chauvinism that pervades her workplace and industry? Or, is Eliza Bright a woman who needs to be destroyed to protect ""the sanctity of gaming culture""?

Soon Eliza is in the cross-hairs of the gaming community, threatened and stalked as they monitor her every move online and across New York City.As the violent power of an angry male collective descends upon everyone in Eliza's life, it becomes increasingly difficult to know who to trust, even when she's eventually taken in and protected by an under-the-radar Collective known as the Sixsterhood. The violence moves from cyberspace to the real world, as a vicious male super-fan known only as The Ghost is determined to exact his revenge on behalf of men everywhere.

Tiger, Tiger|Margaux Fragoso|This extraordinary memoir is an unprecedented glimpse into the psyche of a young girl in free fall and conveys to readers -- including parents and survivors of abuse -- just how completely a pedophile enchants his victim and binds her to him.One summer day, Margaux Fragoso meets Peter Curran at the neighborhood swimming pool, and they begin to play. She is seven; he is fifty-one. When Peter invites her and her mother to his house, the little girl finds a child's paradise of exotic pets and an elaborate backyard garden. Her mother, beset by mental illness and overwhelmed by caring for Margaux, is grateful for the attention Peter lavishes on her, and he creates an imaginative universe for her, much as Lewis Carroll did for his real-life Alice. In time, he insidiously takes on the role of Margaux's playmate, father, and lover. Charming and manipulative, Peter burrows into every aspect of Margaux's life and transforms her from a child fizzing with imagination and affection into a brainwashed young woman on the verge of suicide. But when she is twenty-two, it is Peter -- ill, and wracked with guilt -- who kills himself, at the age of sixty-six. Told with lyricism, depth, and mesmerizing clarity, Tiger, Tiger vividly illustrates the healing power of memory and disclosure. This extraordinary memoir is an unprecedented glimpse into the psyche of a young girl in free fall and conveys to readers -- including parents and survivors of abuse -- just how completely a pedophile enchants his victim and binds her to him.|Hardcover||336.0|March 1, 2011|Farrar, Straus and Giroux||||566.99|3.7|4.3|4493.0|269.0|15.24|3.048|23.114|Memoir|Nonfiction|Biography|Abuse|Biography Memoir|Autobiography|Psychology|Adult|Mental Health|True Crime|0.3465783664459161|0.32229580573951433|0.09492273730684328|0.05960264900662252|0.04194260485651214|0.039735099337748346|0.026490066225165563|0.024282560706401758|0.022075055187637967|0.022075055187637967|388210.93

This Is How You Lose Her|Junot Díaz|On a beach in the Dominican Republic, a doomed relationship flounders. In the heat of a hospital laundry room in New Jersey, a woman does her lover’s washing and thinks about his wife. In Boston, a man buys his love child, his only son, a first baseball bat and glove. At the heart of these stories is the irrepressible, irresistible Yunior, a young hardhead whose longing for love is equaled only by his recklessness—and by the extraordinary women he loves and loses: artistic Alma; the aging Miss Lora; Magdalena, who thinks all Dominican men are cheaters; and the love of his life, whose heartbreak ultimately becomes his own. In prose that is endlessly energetic, inventive, tender, and funny, the stories in This Is How You Lose Her lay bare the infinite longing and inevitable weakness of the human heart. They remind us that passion always triumphs over experience, and that “the half-life of love is forever.”|Hardcover||217.0|September 11, 2012|Riverhead Books||||5443.103999999998|3.75|4.3|93659.0|1459.0|14.605|2.2352|21.59|Fiction|Short Stories|Contemporary|Romance|Literary Fiction|Adult Fiction|Adult|Literature|Novels|Audiobook|0.4267984371408872|0.3286600781429557|0.06757067340841186|0.03884164559871293|0.028499195587221325|0.027350034474833373|0.02689037002987819|0.025051712250057458|0.01815674557572972|0.012181107791312342|271704.34
Madame Fourcade's Secret War: The Daring Young Woman Who Led France's Largest Spy Network Against Hitler|Lynne Olson|"The little-known true story of Marie-Madeleine Fourcade, the woman who headed the largest spy network in occupied France during World War II, from the bestselling author of Citizens of London and Last Hope IslandIn 1941 a thirty-one-year-old Frenchwoman, a young mother born to privilege and known for her beauty and glamour, became the leader of a vast intelligence organization--the only woman to serve as a chef de r�sistance during the war. Strong-willed, independent, and a lifelong rebel against her country's conservative, patriarchal society, Marie-Madeleine Fourcade was temperamentally made for the job. Her group's name was Alliance, but the Gestapo dubbed it Noah's Ark because its agents used the names of animals as their aliases. The name Marie-Madeleine chose for herself was Hedgehog: a tough little animal, unthreatening in appearance, that, as a colleague of hers put it, ""even a lion would hesitate to bite.""No other French spy network lasted as long or supplied as much crucial intelligence--including providing American and British military commanders with a 55-foot-long map of the beaches and roads on which the Allies would land on D-Day--as Alliance. The Gestapo pursued them relentlessly, capturing, torturing, and executing hundreds of its three thousand agents, including Fourcade's own lover and many of her key spies. Although Fourcade, the mother of two young children, moved her headquarters every few weeks, constantly changing her hair color, clothing, and identity, she was captured twice by the Nazis. Both times she managed to escape--once by slipping naked through the bars of her jail cell--and continued to hold her network together even as it repeatedly threatened to crumble around her.Though so many of her agents died defending their country, Fourcade survived the occupation to become active in postwar French politics. Now, in this dramatic account of the war that split France in two and forced its people to live side by side with their hated German occupiers, Lynne Olson tells the fascinating story of a woman who stood up for her nation, her fellow citizens, and herself."|Hardcover||464.0|||||||4.22|4.6|5179.0|1098.0||||History|Nonfiction|Biography|World War II|France|War|Espionage|Historical|Womens|Biography Memoir|0.3289124668435013|0.28205128205128205|0.11671087533156502|0.08576480990274092|0.05481874447391689|0.048629531388152084|0.03006189213085765|0.02210433244916004|0.018567639257294436|0.01237842617152962|238932.35

The Wind Through the Keyhole|Stephen King|Stephen King returns to the rich landscape of Mid-World, the spectacular territory of the Dark Tower fantasy saga that stands as his most beguiling achievement. Roland Deschain and his ka-tet—Jake, Susannah, Eddie, and Oy, the billy-bumbler—encounter a ferocious storm just after crossing the River Whye on their way to the Outer Baronies. As they shelter from the howling gale, Roland tells his friends not just one strange story but two . . . and in so doing, casts new light on his own troubled past. In his early days as a gunslinger, in the guilt-ridden year following his mother’s death, Roland is sent by his father to investigate evidence of a murderous shape-shifter, a “skin-man” preying upon the population around Debaria. Roland takes charge of Bill Streeter, the brave but terrified boy who is the sole surviving witness to the beast’s most recent slaughter. Only a teenager himself, Roland calms the boy and prepares him for the following day’s trials by reciting a story from the Magic Tales of the Eld that his mother often read to him at bedtime. “A person’s never too old for stories,” Roland says to Bill. “Man and boy, girl and woman, never too old. We live for them.” And indeed, the tale that Roland unfolds, the legend of Tim Stoutheart, is a timeless treasure for all ages, a story that lives for us.King began the Dark Tower series in 1974; it gained momentum in the 1980s; and he brought it to a thrilling conclusion when the last three novels were published in 2003 and 2004. The Wind Through the Keyhole is sure to fascinate avid fans of the Dark Tower epic. But this novel also stands on its own for all readers, an enchanting and haunting journey to Roland’s world and testimony to the power of Stephen King’s storytelling magic.~from first edition jacket|Hardcover|US / Canada|309.0|April 24, 2012|Scribner||||566.99|4.15|4.7|68882.0|3630.0|15.24|3.048|22.86|Fantasy|Fiction|Horror|Science Fiction|Westerns|Audiobook|Adventure|Science Fiction Fantasy|Novels|Thriller|0.5230941704035874|0.1852017937219731|0.13968609865470852|0.04125560538116592|0.026681614349775784|0.02242152466367713|0.021076233183856503|0.01905829596412556|0.010986547085201795|0.010538116591928251|445814.56

Lots of Candles, Plenty of Cake|Anna Quindlen|"In this irresistible memoir, the #1 New York Times bestselling author writes about her life and the lives of women today, looking back and ahead - and celebrating it all - as she considers marriage, girlfriends, our mothers, faith, loss, all that stuff in our closets, and more. It's odd when I think of the arc of my life, from child to young woman to aging adult. First I was who I was. Then I didn't know who I was. Then I invented someone, and became her. Then I began to like what I'd invented. And finally I was what I was again. It turned out I wasn't alone in that particular progression. As she did in her beloved New York Times columns, and in A Short Guide to a Happy Life, Quindlen says for us here what we may wish we could have said ourselves. Using her past, present, and future to explore what matters most to women at different ages, Quindlen talks aboutMarriage: ""A safety net of small white lies can be the bedrock of a successful marriage. You wouldn't believe how cheaply I can do a kitchen renovation.""Girlfriends: ""Real friends offer both hard truths and soft landings and realize that it's sometimes more important to be nice than to be honest."" Our bodies: ""I've finally recognized my body for what it is, a personality-delivery system, designed expressly to carry my character from place to place, now and in the years to come. It's like a car, and while I like a red convertible or even a Bentley as well as the next person, what I really need are four tires and an engine.""Parenting: ""Being a parent is not transactional. We do not get what we give. It is the ultimate pay-it-forward: We are good parents, not so they will be loving enough to stay with us, but so they will be strong enough to leave us."" From childhood memories to manic motherhood to middle age, Quindlen uses the events of her own life to illuminate our own. Along with the downsides of age, she says, can come wisdom, a perspective on life that makes it both satisfying and even joyful. So here's to lots of candles, plenty of cake."|Hardcover||182.0|April 24, 2012|Random House||||498.9512|3.72|4.2|16755|864.0|16.154400000000006|2.1844|24.2062|Memoir|Nonfiction|Biography|Essays|Biography Memoir|Audiobook|Humor|Autobiography|Adult|Book Club|0.34537725823591925|0.3358129649309245|0.06907545164718384|0.060573857598299675|0.0563230605738576|0.03400637619553666|0.02869287991498405|0.02763018065887354|0.025504782146652496|0.01700318809776833|165881.13

The Chameleon Couch|Yusef Komunyakaa|"A new and intimate collection from one of America's most important poetsThe latest collection from one of our preeminent poets, The Chameleon Couch is also one of Yusef Komunyakaa's most personal to date. As in his breakthrough work, Copacetic, Komunyakaa writes again of music as muse--from a blues club in the East Village to the shakuhachi of Basho. Beginning with ""Canticle,"" this varied new collection often returns to the idea of poem as hymn, ethereal and haunting, as Komunyakaa reveals glimpses of memory, myth, and violence. With contemplations that spring up along walks or memories conjured by the rhythms of New York, Komunyakaa pays tribute more than ever before to those who came before him.The book moves seamlessly across cultural and historical boundaries, evoking Komunyakaa's capacity for cultural excavation, through artifact and place. The Chameleon Couch begins in and never fully leaves the present--an urban modernity framed, brilliantly, in pastoral-minded verse. The poems seek the cracks beneath the landscape, whether New York or Ghana or Poland, finding in each elements of wisdom or unexpected beauty. The collection is sensually, beautifully relaxed in rhetoric; in poems like ""Cape Coast Castle,"" Komunyakaa reminds us of his gift for combining the personal with the universal, one moment addressing a lover, the next moving the focus outward, until both poet and reader are implicated in the book's startling world."|Hardcover||128.0|March 15, 2011|Farrar, Straus and Giroux||||4354.4832|3.87|4.3|249.0|10.0|14.4018|1.6002|21.7424|Poetry||||||||||1.0||||||||||346488.0
The Delirium Brief|Charles Stross|Bob Howard’s career in the Laundry, the secret British government agency dedicated to protecting the world from unspeakable horrors from beyond spacetime, has entailed high combat, brilliant hacking, ancient magic, and combat with indescribably repellent creatures of pure evil. It has also involved a wearying amount of paperwork and office politics, and his expense reports are still a mess.Now, following the invasion of Yorkshire by the Host of Air and Darkness, the Laundry’s existence has become public, and Bob is being trotted out on TV to answer pointed questions about elven asylum seekers. What neither Bob nor his managers have foreseen is that their organization has earned the attention of a horror far more terrifying than any demon: a British government looking for public services to privatize. There’s a lot of potential shareholder value in the Laundry’s “knowledge assets.”Inch by inch, Bob Howard and his managers are forced to consider the truly unthinkable: a coup against the British government itself.|Hardcover||368.0|||||||4.26|4.5|4634.0|485.0||||Fantasy|Horror|Urban Fantasy|Science Fiction|Fiction|Lovecraftian|Thriller|Espionage|Audiobook|Cthulhu Mythos|0.2427007299270073|0.2299270072992701|0.18795620437956204|0.1386861313868613|0.09854014598540146|0.025547445255474453|0.021897810218978103|0.020072992700729927|0.01824817518248175|0.016423357664233574|186237.3

America|Mike Bond|The Sixties shook America to its foundation – the assassination of an idealistic young president, a tragic and unpopular war, a battle for civil rights, a cosmic clash of riots and burning cities, and an explosion of sex, drugs and rock’n roll.For four young people, the Sixties is a decade of promise and freedom. For orphaned Troy, it’s the joy of living with his new family and exploring the world of flight and outer space. For Tara, the girl he loves, the power of song as she evolves into a rock’n roll star. For his new brother, Mick, a football hero and rebel, a time to question everything, including the fast-growing war in Vietnam. And for Daisy, the girl Mick loves, a chance to fight for equality, join the Peace Corps, and expand her study of the human mind.America is the first of Mike Bond’s seven-volume historical novel series, capturing the victories and heartbreaks of the last 70 years and of our nation’s most profound upheavals since the Civil War – a time that defined the end of the 20th Century and where we are today.Through the wild, joyous, heartbroken and visionary lives of four young people and many others, the Sixties come alive again, as do its questions: what is life? What is freedom? What was lost, what was won?|Kindle Edition|||May 4, 2021|Mike Bond Books|||||3.33|5.0|49|2.0||||Historical Fiction|Fiction|Historical||||||||0.5625|0.25|0.1875||||||||43166.63000000001

The Art of Fermentation: An in-Depth Exploration of Essential Concepts and Processes from Around the World|Sandor Ellix Katz|Winner of the 2013 James Beard Foundation Book Award for Reference and Scholarship, and a New York Times bestseller, The Art of Fermentation is the most comprehensive guide to do-it-yourself home fermentation ever published. Sandor Katz presents the concepts and processes behind fermentation in ways that are simple enough to guide a reader through their first experience making sauerkraut or yogurt, and in-depth enough to provide greater understanding and insight for experienced practitioners.While Katz expertly contextualizes fermentation in terms of biological and cultural evolution, health and nutrition, and even economics, this is primarily a compendium of practical information--how the processes work; parameters for safety; techniques for effective preservation; troubleshooting; and more.With two-color illustrations and extended resources, this book provides essential wisdom for cooks, homesteaders, farmers, gleaners, foragers, and food lovers of any kind who want to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for arguably the oldest form of food preservation, and part of the roots of culture itself.Readers will find detailed information on fermenting vegetables; sugars into alcohol (meads, wines, and ciders); sour tonic beverages; milk; grains and starchy tubers; beers (and other grain-based alcoholic beverages); beans; seeds; nuts; fish; meat; and eggs, as well as growing mold cultures, using fermentation in agriculture, art, and energy production, and considerations for commercial enterprises. Sandor Katz has introduced what will undoubtedly remain a classic in food literature, and is the first--and only--of its kind.|Hardcover||528.0|May 14, 2012|Chelsea Green Publishing||||1270.0576|4.43|4.7|3680|1939.0|19.05|3.81|24.765|Food|Cookbooks|Cooking|Nonfiction|Health|Reference|Science|Nutrition|Food and Drink|Foodie|0.2689265536723164|0.2440677966101695|0.1367231638418079|0.11864406779661014|0.07005649717514124|0.04858757062146893|0.03615819209039548|0.03389830508474576|0.02598870056497175|0.01694915254237288|371030.9

The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics|Daniel James Brown|For readers of Laura Hillenbrand's Seabiscuit and Unbroken, the dramatic story of the American rowing team that stunned the world at Hitler's 1936 Berlin Olympics.Daniel James Brown's robust book tells the story of the University of Washington's 1936 eight-oar crew and their epic quest for an Olympic gold medal, a team that transformed the sport and grabbed the attention of millions of Americans. The sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the boys defeated elite rivals first from eastern and British universities and finally the German crew rowing for Adolf Hitler in the Olympic games in Berlin, 1936.The emotional heart of the story lies with one rower, Joe Rantz, a teenager without family or prospects, who rows not for glory, but to regain his shattered self-regard and to find a place he can call home. The crew is assembled by an enigmatic coach and mentored by a visionary, eccentric British boat builder, but it is their trust in each other that makes them a victorious team. They remind the country of what can be done when everyone quite literally pulls together—a perfect melding of commitment, determination, and optimism.Drawing on the boys' own diaries and journals, their photos and memories of a once-in-a-lifetime shared dream, The Boys in the Boat is an irresistible story about beating the odds and finding hope in the most desperate of times—the improbable, intimate story of nine working-class boys from the American west who, in the depths of the Great Depression, showed the world what true grit really meant. It will appeal to readers of Erik Larson, Timothy Egan, James Bradley, and David Halberstam's The Amateurs.|Hardcover||404.0|January 1, 2013|Viking||1260L||635.0287999999998|4.34|4.8|239709.0|26469.0|16.002|3.302|23.622000000000003|Nonfiction|History|Sports|Biography|Audiobook|Historical|Book Club|World War II|American History|Memoir|0.40279354985237337|0.2407449466272996|0.099931864637747|0.0897115602997956|0.040199863729275497|0.03792868498750852|0.034067681126504656|0.020327049738814443|0.019305019305019305|0.014989779695662047|200674.3

Now, Bulikov’s history has been censored and erased, its citizens subjugated. But the surreal landscape of the city itself, forever altered by the thousands of miracles its guardians once worked upon it, stands as a haunting reminder of its former supremacy.Into this broken city steps Shara Thivani. Officially, the unassuming young woman is just another junior diplomat sent by Bulikov’s oppressors. Unofficially, she is one of her country’s most accomplished spies, dispatched — along with her terrifying “secretary”, Sigrud — to solve a murder.But as Shara pursues the killer, she starts to suspect that the beings who ruled this terrible place may not be as dead as they seem, and that Bulikov’s cruel reign may not yet be over.A tale of vast conspiracies, dead gods, and buried histories, City of Stairs is at once a gripping spy novel and a stunningly original work of fantasy.|Paperback||452.0|September 9, 2014|Crown||||5533.822399999999|4.05|4.4|32103.0|724.0|12.954|2.54|20.32|Fantasy|Fiction|Mystery|Urban Fantasy|Science Fiction|Adult|Young Adult|Childrens|High Fantasy|Epic Fantasy|0.6889587816586658|0.07415990730011587|0.05926171163714618|0.04717761959940407|0.032610494951167024|0.025658003641781158|0.02218175798708823|0.017546763780830987|0.017050157258731997|0.015394802185068697|112464.23

Sure, he’s always been a little bit different—his tusk isn’t as long, he’s not as good of a swimmer, and he really doesn’t enjoy the cuisine. Then one night, an extra strong current sweeps Kelp to the surface, where he spots a mysterious creature that looks just like him! Kelp discovers that he and the creature are actually unicorns. The revelation leaves him torn: is he a land narwhal or a sea unicorn?

Blackout|John Rocco|"One hot summer night in the city, all the power goes out. The TV shuts off and a boy wails, ""Mommm!"" His sister can no longer use the phone, Mom can't work on her computer, and Dad can't finish cooking dinner. What's a family to do? When they go up to the roof to escape the heat, they find the lights--in stars that can be seen for a change--and so many neighbors it's like a block party in the sky! On the street below, people are having just as much fun--talking, rollerblading, and eating ice cream before it melts. The boy and his family enjoy being not so busy for once. They even have time to play a board game together. When the electricity is restored, everything can go back to normal . . . but not everyone likes normal. The boy switches off the lights, and out comes the board game again.Using a combination of panels and full bleed illustrations that move from color to black-and-white and back to color, John Rocco shows that if we are willing to put our cares aside for a while, there is party potential in a summer blackout."|Hardcover||40.0|May 24, 2011|Little, Brown Books for Young Readers|3 - 5 years|330L|Preschool - Kindergarten|498.9512|4.16|4.7|10420.0|181.0|24.765|1.3970000000000002|28.702|Picture Books|Childrens|Realistic Fiction|Family|Fiction|Cultural|Storytime|Graphic Novels|Kids|Juvenile|0.591374269005848|0.1023391812865497|0.09064327485380116|0.08625730994152046|0.04751461988304093|0.029970760233918124|0.027046783625731|0.009502923976608188|0.008040935672514621|0.007309941520467836|136574.02000000002
Growing Things and Other Stories|Paul Tremblay|"A chilling anthology featuring nineteen pieces of short fiction from the multiple award-winning author of the national bestseller The Cabin at the End of the World and A Head Full of Ghosts..In The Teacher, a Bram Stoker Award nominee for best short story, a student is forced to watch a disturbing video that will haunt and torment her and her classmates’ lives.Four men rob a pawn shop at gunpoint only to vanish, one-by-one, as they speed away from the crime scene in The Getaway.In Swim Wants to Know If It’s as Bad as Swim Thinks, a meth addict kidnaps her daughter from her estranged mother as their town is terrorized by a giant monster . . . or not.Joining these haunting works are stories linked to Tremblay’s previous novels. The tour de force metafictional novella Notes from the Dog Walkers deconstructs horror and publishing, possibly bringing in a character from A Head Full of Ghosts, all while serving as a prequel to Disappearance at Devil’s Rock. “The Thirteenth Temple” follows another character from A Head Full of Ghosts—Merry, who has published a tell-all memoir written years after the events of the novel. And the title story, Growing Things, a shivery tale loosely shared between the sisters in A Head Full of Ghosts, is told here in full.From global catastrophe to the demons inside our heads, Tremblay illuminates our primal fears and darkest dreams in startlingly original fiction that leaves us unmoored. As he lowers the sky and yanks the ground from beneath our feet, we are compelled to contemplate the darkness inside our own hearts and minds.Growing things --Swim wants to know if it's as bad as swim thinks --Something about birds --The getaway --Nineteen snapshots of Dennisport --Where we all will be --The teacher --Notes for ""The Barn in the Wild"" --_______ --Our town's monster --A haunted house is a wheel upon which some are broken --It won't go away --Notes from the dog walkers --Further questions for the somnambulist --The ice tower --The society of the monsterhood --Her red right hand --It's against the law to feed the ducks --The thirteenth temple --Notes --Acknowledgments --Credits"|Hardcover||352.0|||||||3.5|4.1|4127.0|201.0||||Horror|Short Stories|Fiction|Anthologies|Adult|Thriller|Audiobook|Short Story Collection|Fantasy|Adult Fiction|0.4918625678119349|0.2911392405063291|0.11211573236889692|0.02531645569620253|0.02079566003616637|0.018083182640144663|0.011754068716094029|0.0108499095840868|0.009041591320072331|0.009041591320072331|375217.63
The Ocean at the End of the Lane|Neil Gaiman|Sussex, England. A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie—magical, comforting, wise beyond her years—promised to protect him, no matter what.A groundbreaking work from a master, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out. It is a stirring, terrifying, and elegiac fable as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark.|Hardcover|First Edition|181.0|June 18, 2013|William Morrow||||5080.2304|4.0|4.5|508372|10618.0|1.7779999999999998|12.954|19.812|Fantasy|Fiction|Magical Realism|Horror|Audiobook|Young Adult|Adult|Science Fiction Fantasy|Adult Fiction|Paranormal|0.5061932545006396|0.21802751864216405|0.0575645065676578|0.057439705469408124|0.038657140182833616|0.035162709431842985|0.030420267698355742|0.019468971326947682|0.019094568032198684|0.017971358147951703|288740.0

N-4 Down: The Hunt for the Arctic Airship Italia|Mark Piesing|The riveting true story of the largest polar rescue mission in history: the desperate race to find the survivors of the glamorous Arctic airship Italia, which crashed near the North Pole in 1928.During the Roaring Twenties, zeppelin travel embodied the exuberant spirit of the age. Germany’s luxurious Graf Zeppelin ran passenger service from Germany to Brazil; Britain’s Imperial Airship Scheme was launched to connect an empire; in America, the iconic spire of the rising Empire State Building was designed as a docking tower for airships.But the new mode of transport offered something else, too: a new frontier of exploration. Whereas previous Arctic and Antarctic explorers had subjected themselves to horrific—often deadly—conditions in their attempts to reach uncharted lands, airships held out the possibility of speedily soaring over the hazards.In 1926, the famed Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen—the first man to reach the South Pole—partnered with the Italian airship designer General Umberto Nobile to pioneer flight over the North Pole. As Mark Piesing reveals in this masterful account, while that mission was thought of as a great success, it was in fact riddled with near-disasters and political pitfalls.In May 1928, his relationship with Amundsen corroded beyond the point of collaboration, Nobile, his dog, and a crew of fourteen Italians, one Swede, and one Czech, set off on their own in the airship Italia—code-named N-4—to discover new lands in the Arctic Circle and to become the first airship to land men on the pole. Near the North Pole they hit a terrible storm and crashed on to the ice. Six crew members were never seen again; the injured (including Nobile) took refuge on ice flows, unprepared for the wretched conditions and with little hope for survival.Coincidentally, in Oslo a gathering of famous Arctic explorers had assembled for a celebration of the first successful flight from Alaska to Norway. Hearing of the accident, they (Amundsen among them) organized the largest international polar rescue expedition in history. As the weeks passed, the survivors engaged in a last-ditch struggle against weather, polar bears and despair. When they were spotted at last, the search plane landed—but the pilot announced that there was only room for one passenger…Braiding together the gripping accounts of the survivors and their heroic rescuers, N-4 Down tells the unforgettable true story of what happened when the glamor and restless daring of the zeppelin age collided with the harsh reality of Earth’s extremes.|Hardcover||352.0|August 31, 2021|Custom House||||453.592|0.0||0||15.24|22.86||||||||||||||||||||||317036.52

It's up to witch-turned-daywalking-demon Rachel Morgan to avert catastrophe and keep life from changing... for the worse.While saving the world is important, it isn't Rachel's only motivation. There's also the small fact that she caused the ley line to rip in the first place, setting off a chain reaction of unfortunate events.

He's already kidnapped her friend and goddaughter to lure her out, and if Rachel doesn't give herself up soon, they'll die.But Rachel has more than a few impressive and frightening skills of her own, and she isn't going to hand over her soul and her life without one hell of a fight. She's also got a surprise: elven tycoon Trent Kalamack. With this unlikely ally beside her—a prospect both thrilling and unnerving—she's going to return to the ever after, kick some demon butt, rescue her loved ones... and prevent an apocalypse before it's too late.

The Drive to Learn: What the East Asian Experience Tells Us about Raising Students Who Excel|Cornelius N. Grove|"This is the first of two books in which Cornelius Grove reveals the differences in societal values that explain why East Asian students always gain much higher scores on the international comparative tests than American students. While Grove’s second book explores schools in East Asia, “The Drive to Learn” explores HOMES there, i.e., the ways in which parents instill in young children a determination to excel in academic learning.At the beginning of this accessible, short book (138 text pages), Grove shares the conclusion he arrived at through reading multiple research reports: In relation to American children, East Asian children are “more receptive” to classroom learning.The first seven chapters offer a step-by-step explanation of why East Asian children are comparatively more receptive to learning in classrooms. The reasons are grounded in the characteristics of East Asian culture, which Grove explains in terms of psychology, sociology, and history. Among the many topics discussed are intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation, passive vs. active parenting, and the assumptions made about newborns.Next, two chapters reveal the mindsets and practices of East Asian parents that support their children’s academic learning, after which a third chapter asks, “So What Should We Do?” A final chapter addresses the questions of who is responsible for a student’s learning and why East Asians are believed to lack creativity.East Asian children’s drive to learn in school is stronger that the comparable drive in American children. The difference is a deeply ingrained set of values that respects and craves the type of knowledge acquired through academic study. Through modeling, high expectations, and active academic support, East Asian parents pass along these values to their children.Don't miss Cornelius Grove's blog, ""Pleasures & Perils of Writing Non-Fiction."""|Paperback||182.0|June 5, 2017|Rowman & Littlefield Publishers||||4490.5608|4.6|5.0|5|1.0|15.1892|1.3716000000000002|22.9616|||||||||||||||||||||389799.0

Jaouen and his arch rival, Gaston Delaroche, are investigating a suspected Royalist plot to unseat Bonaparte, and Laura's mission is to report any suspicious findings. At first the job is as lively as Latin textbooks and knitting, but Laura begins to notice strange behavior from Jaouen-secret meetings and odd comings and goings. As Laura edges herself closer to her employer, she makes a shocking discovery and is surprised to learn that she has far more in common with Jaouen than she originally thought... As their plots begin to unravel, Laura and Jaouen are forced on the run with the children, and with the help of the Pink Carnation they escape to the countryside, traveling as husband and wife. But Delaroche will stop at nothing to take down his nemesis.

What Was Said to Me: The Life of Sti’tum’atul’wut, a Cowichan Woman|Helene Demers|A narrative of resistance and resilience spanning seven decades in the life of a tireless advocate for Indigenous language preservation. Life histories are a form of contemporary social history and convey important messages about identity, cosmology, social behaviour and one’s place in the world. This first-person oral history—the first of its kind ever published by the Royal BC Museum—documents a period of profound social change through the lens of Sti’tum’atul’wut—also known as Mrs. Ruby Peter—a Cowichan elder who made it her life’s work to share and safeguard the ancient language of her people: Hul’q’umi’num’. Over seven decades, Sti’tum’atul’wut mentored hundreds of students and teachers and helped thousands of people to develop a basic knowledge of the Hul’q’umi’num’ language. She contributed to dictionaries and grammars, and helped assemble a valuable corpus of stories, sound and video files—with more than 10,000 pages of texts from Hul’q’umi’num’ speakers—that has been described as “a treasure of linguistic and cultural knowledge.” Without her passion, commitment and expertise, this rich legacy of material would not exist for future generations|Paperback||224.0|June 18, 2021|The Royal British Columbia Museum||||503.48712|4.25||4||15.24|22.86||Nonfiction||||||||||1.0||||||||||288018.15

Attrib. and Other Stories|Eley Williams|It's just the real inexplicable gorgeous brilliant thing this book. I love it in a way I usually reserve for people. --Max Porter A dazzling, prizewinning short story collection that showcases a bold new talentEley Williams has been a literary sensation ever since this collection of experimental short fiction was published in the UK. Lauded as elegant (The Guardian) and exhilarating (Vanity Fair), Attrib. and Other Stories won the James Tait Black Prize, was longlisted for the Dylan Thomas Prize, and was named a best book of the year by The Guardian.Attrib. presents a cast of unforgettable characters standing at the precipice of emotional events (a disastrous breakup, a successful date, an unexpected arrival) and finding it fiendishly impossible to express themselves. With intimate, irreverent, and playful prose, Eley Williams rejoices in both the possibilities and limitations of language, as well as the very human need to be known and understood--despite our own best efforts.Original and inventive in the vein of Lydia Davis, Deborah Eisenberg, and Amy Hempel, these stories are emotionally delicate and tenderly introspective (New Statesman) and an absolute must-read (The London Magazine).|Paperback||160.0|May 18, 2021|Anchor||||2630.8336|3.9|4.2|931|63.0|13.0556|1.1176|20.2438|Short Stories|Fiction|Literary Fiction|Language|21st Century|Literature|Womens|Queer|British Literature|Contemporary|0.6277372262773723|0.21897810218978106|0.0291970802919708|0.025547445255474453|0.01824817518248175|0.01824817518248175|0.01824817518248175|0.0145985401459854|0.0145985401459854|0.0145985401459854|209192.13

It's a bloody business overthrowing a king...Field Marshal Tamas' coup against his king sent corrupt aristocrats to the guillotine and brought bread to the starving.

The Memory Palace|Mira Bartok|"The Memory Palace is a breathtaking literary memoir about the complex meaning of love, truth, and the capacity for forgiveness among family.""People have abandoned their loved ones for much less than you’ve been through,"" Mira Bartók is told at her mother’s memorial service. It is a poignant observation about the relationship between Mira, her sister, and their mentally ill mother. Before she was struck with schizophrenia at the age of nineteen, beautiful piano protégé Norma Herr had been the most vibrant personality in the room. She loved her daughters and did her best to raise them well, but as her mental state deteriorated, Norma spoke less about Chopin and more about Nazis and her fear that her daughters would be kidnapped, murdered, or raped. When the girls left for college, the harassment escalated--Norma called them obsessively, appeared at their apartments or jobs, threatened to kill herself if they did not return home. After a traumatic encounter, Mira and her sister were left with no choice but to change their names and sever all contact with Norma in order to stay safe. But while Mira pursued her career as an artist--exploring the ancient romance of Florence, the eerie mysticism of northern Norway, and the raw desert of Israel--the haunting memories of her mother were never far away. Then one day, Mira’s life changed forever after a debilitating car accident. As she struggled to recover from a traumatic brain injury, she was confronted with a need to recontextualize her life--she had to relearn how to paint, read, and interact with the outside world. In her search for a way back to her lost self, Mira reached out to the homeless shelter where she believed her mother was living and discovered that Norma was dying. Mira and her sister traveled to Cleveland, where they shared an extraordinary reconciliation with their mother that none of them had thought possible. At the hospital, Mira discovered a set of keys that opened a storage unit Norma had been keeping for seventeen years. Filled with family photos, childhood toys, and ephemera from Norma’s life, the storage unit brought back a flood of previous memories that Mira had thought were lost to her forever. The Memory Palace is a breathtaking literary memoir about the complex meaning of love, truth, and the capacity for forgiveness among family. Through stunning prose and original art created by the author in tandem with the text, The Memory Palace explores the connections between mother and daughter that cannot be broken no matter how much exists--or is lost--between them."|Hardcover||320.0|January 11, 2011|Free Press||||476.2716|3.5|4.2|7251.0|182.0|15.24|2.7940000000000005|22.86|Memoir|Nonfiction|Biography|Mental Illness|Psychology|Mental Health|Biography Memoir|Autobiography|Family|Health|0.4278606965174129|0.2255389718076285|0.06633499170812604|0.06467661691542287|0.05306799336650083|0.04311774461028192|0.03980099502487562|0.03482587064676617|0.02819237147595357|0.01658374792703151|193888.91

Free Will|Sam Harris|Belief in free will touches nearly everything that human beings value. It is difficult to think about law, politics, religion, public policy, intimate relationships, morality—as well as feelings of remorse or personal achievement—without first imagining that every person is the true source of his or her thoughts and actions. And yet the facts tell us that free will is an illusion.In this enlightening book, Sam Harris argues that this truth about the human mind does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of social and political freedom, but it can and should change the way we think about some of the most important questions in life.|Paperback||96.0|March 6, 2012|Free Press||||1905.0864|3.87|4.3|28166|1864.0|14.3002|1.016|20.32|Philosophy|Nonfiction|Psychology|Science|Religion|Neuroscience|Atheism|Audiobook|Sociology|Essays|0.4171138938580799|0.24031007751937986|0.11627906976744184|0.11449016100178892|0.0345855694692904|0.03220035778175313|0.017590936195587357|0.011627906976744186|0.008348240906380441|0.007453786523553965|132820.4

Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World|Michael   Lewis|The tsunami of cheap credit that rolled across the planet between 2002 and 2008 was more than a simple financial phenomenon: it was temptation, offering entire societies the chance to reveal aspects of their characters they could not normally afford to indulge.Icelanders wanted to stop fishing and become investment bankers. The Greeks wanted to turn their country into a piñata stuffed with cash and allow as many citizens as possible to take a whack at it. The Germans wanted to be even more German; the Irish wanted to stop being Irish.Michael Lewis's investigation of bubbles beyond our shores is so brilliantly, sadly hilarious that it leads the American reader to a comfortable complacency: oh, those foolish foreigners. But when he turns a merciless eye on California and Washington, DC, we see that the narrative is a trap baited with humor, and we understand the reckoning that awaits the greatest and greediest of debtor nations.|Hardcover||213.0|October 3, 2011|W.

Supergods: What Masked Vigilantes, Miraculous Mutants, and a Sun God from Smallville Can Teach Us About Being Human|Grant Morrison|From one of the most acclaimed and profound writers in the world of comics comes a thrilling and provocative exploration of humankind’s great modern myth: the superhero The first superhero comic ever published, Action Comics no. 1 in 1938, introduced the world to something both unprecedented and timeless: Superman, a caped god for the modern age. In a matter of years, the skies of the imaginary world were filled with strange mutants, aliens, and vigilantes: Batman, Wonder Woman, the Fantastic Four, Iron Man, and the X-Men—the list of names as familiar as our own. In less than a century, they’ve gone from not existing at all to being everywhere we look: on our movie and television screens, in our videogames and dreams. But what are they trying to tell us?For Grant Morrison, arguably the greatest of contemporary chroniclers of the “superworld,” these heroes are powerful archetypes whose ongoing, decades-spanning story arcs reflect and predict the course of human existence: Through them we tell the story of ourselves, our troubled history, and our starry aspirations. In this exhilarating work of a lifetime, Morrison draws on art, science, mythology, and his own astonishing journeys through this shadow universe to provide the first true history of the superhero—why they matter, why they will always be with us, and what they tell us about who we are . . . and what we may yet become.|Hardcover||444.0|July 19, 2011|Spiegel & Grau||||780.1782400000002|3.84|4.4|7758.0|240.0|16.256|3.2004|24.1554|Nonfiction|Comics|History|Biography|Superheroes|Graphic Novels|Pop Culture|Memoir|Philosophy|Cultural|0.42948717948717946|0.2264957264957265|0.06623931623931624|0.06623931623931624|0.061965811965811975|0.045940170940170943|0.02991452991452992|0.027777777777777776|0.026709401709401708|0.019230769230769232|152310.35

Wanderlust: A Love Affair with Five Continents|Elisabeth Eaves|Spanning 15 years of travel, beginning when she is a sophomore in college, Wanderlust documents Elisabeth Eaves's insatiable hunger for the rush of the unfamiliar and the experience of encountering new people and cultures. Young and independent, she crisscrosses five continents and chases the exotic, both in culture and in romance. In the jungles of Papua New Guinea, she loses herself -- literally -- to an Australian tour guide; in Cairo, she reconnects with her high school sweetheart, only to discover the beginning of a pattern that will characterize her life over the long-term: while long-distance relationships work well for her, traditional relationships do not.Wanderlust, however, is more than a chronological conquest of men and countries: at its core, it's a journey of self-discovery. In the course of her travels, Eaves finds herself and the sense of home she's been lacking since childhood -- and she sheds light on a growing culture of young women who have the freedom and inclination to define their own, increasingly global, lifestyles, unfettered by traditional roles and conventions of past generations of women.|Paperback||304.0|May 24, 2011|Seal Press||||5034.8712|3.5|3.5|3670.0|128.0|13.97|2.2352|20.955|Travel|Nonfiction|Memoir|Biography|Biography Memoir|Audiobook|Adventure|Adult|Contemporary|International|0.6041189931350115|0.20594965675057209|0.09382151029748284|0.01830663615560641|0.01601830663615561|0.013729977116704805|0.013729977116704805|0.013729977116704805|0.011441647597254004|0.009153318077803205|77815.43
Console Wars: Sega, Nintendo, and the Battle that Defined a Generation|Blake J. Harris|Following the success of The Accidental Billionaires and Moneyball comes Console Wars—a mesmerizing, behind-the-scenes business thriller that chronicles how Sega, a small, scrappy gaming company led by an unlikely visionary and a team of rebels, took on the juggernaut Nintendo and revolutionized the video game industry.In 1990, Nintendo had a virtual monopoly on the video game industry. Sega, on the other hand, was just a faltering arcade company with big aspirations and even bigger personalities. But that would all change with the arrival of Tom Kalinske, a man who knew nothing about videogames and everything about fighting uphill battles. His unconventional tactics, combined with the blood, sweat and bold ideas of his renegade employees, transformed Sega and eventually led to a ruthless David-and-Goliath showdown with rival Nintendo.The battle was vicious, relentless, and highly profitable, eventually sparking a global corporate war that would be fought on several fronts: from living rooms and schoolyards to boardrooms and Congress. It was a once-in-a-lifetime, no-holds-barred conflict that pitted brother against brother, kid against adult, Sonic against Mario, and the US against Japan.Based on over two hundred interviews with former Sega and Nintendo employees, Console Wars is the underdog tale of how Kalinske miraculously turned an industry punchline into a market leader. It's the story of how a humble family man, with an extraordinary imagination and a gift for turning problems into competitive advantages, inspired a team of underdogs to slay a giant and, as a result, birth a $60 billion dollar industry.|Hardcover||576.0|May 13, 2014|It Books||||748.4268|3.95|4.5|9503.0|1008.0|15.24|4.3180000000000005|22.86|Nonfiction|History|Business|Video Games|Gaming|Games|Technology|Audiobook|Biography|Pop Culture|0.2261437908496732|0.21176470588235294|0.1607843137254902|0.13333333333333333|0.06928104575163399|0.05882352941176471|0.054901960784313725|0.035294117647058816|0.032679738562091505|0.01699346405228758|268095.09

The Greater Journey: Americans in Paris|David McCullough|"The Greater Journey is the enthralling, inspiring - and until now, untold - story of the adventurous American artists, writers, doctors, politicians, architects, and others of high aspiration who set off for Paris in the years between 1830 and 1900, ambitious to excel in their work.After risking the hazardous journey across the Atlantic, these Americans embarked on a greater journey in the City of Light. Most had never left home, never experienced a different culture. None had any guarantee of success. That they achieved so much for themselves and their country profoundly altered American history. As David McCullough writes, ""Not all pioneers went west."" Elizabeth Blackwell, the first female doctor in America, was one of this intrepid band. Another was Charles Sumner, who enrolled at the Sorbonne because of a burning desire to know more about everything. There he saw black students with the same ambition he had, and when he returned home, he would become the most powerful, unyielding voice for abolition in the U.S. Senate, almost at the cost of his life. Two staunch friends, James Fenimore Cooper and Samuel F. B. Morse, worked unrelentingly every day in Paris, Cooper writing and Morse painting what would be his masterpiece. From something he saw in France, Morse would also bring home his momentous idea for the telegraph. Pianist Louis Moreau Gottschalk from New Orleans launched his spectacular career performing in Paris at age 15. George P. A. Healy, who had almost no money and little education, took the gamble of a lifetime and with no prospects whatsoever in Paris became one of the most celebrated portrait painters of the day. His subjects included Abraham Lincoln. Medical student Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote home of his toil and the exhilaration in ""being at the center of things"" in what was then the medical capital of the world. From all they learned in Paris, Holmes and his fellow ""medicals"" were to exert lasting influence on the profession of medicine in the United States. Writers Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, and Henry James were all ""discovering"" Paris, marveling at the treasures in the Louvre, or out with the Sunday throngs strolling the city's boulevards and gardens. ""At last I have come into a dreamland,"" wrote Harriet Beecher Stowe, seeking escape from the notoriety Uncle Tom's Cabin had brought her. Almost forgotten today, the heroic American ambassador Elihu Washburne bravely remained at his post through the Franco-Prussian War, the long Siege of Paris and even more atrocious nightmare of the Commune. His vivid account in his diary of the starvation and suffering endured by the people of Paris (drawn on here for the first time) is one readers will never forget. The genius of sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, the son of an immigrant shoemaker, and of painters Mary Cassatt and John Singer Sargent, three of the greatest American artists ever, would flourish in Paris, inspired by the examples of brilliant French masters, and by Paris itself. Nearly all of these Americans, whatever their troubles learning French, their spells of homesickness, and their suffering in the raw cold winters by the Seine, spent many of the happiest days and nights of their lives in Paris. McCullough tells this sweeping, fascinating story with power and intimacy, bringing us into the lives of remarkable men and women who, in Saint-Gaudens's phrase, longed ""to soar into the blue."" The Greater Journey is itself a masterpiece."|Hardcover||558.0|May 24, 2011|Simon & Schuster||||1070.47712|3.92|4.5|18196.0|1329.0|15.875|4.3180000000000005|23.495|History|Nonfiction|France|Biography|American History|Travel|Art|Historical|Audiobook|19th Century|0.4458426966292135|0.2606741573033708|0.06606741573033707|0.053932584269662916|0.04449438202247191|0.0350561797752809|0.031011235955056175|0.025617977528089888|0.021123595505617977|0.016179775280898874|335227.14
Seduction|M.J. Rose|From the author of The Book of Lost Fragrances comes a haunting novel about a grieving woman who discovers the lost journal of novelist Victor Hugo, awakening a mystery that spans centuries.In 1843, novelist Victor Hugo’s beloved nineteen-year-old daughter drowned. Ten years later, Hugo began participating in hundreds of séances to reestablish contact with her. In the process, he claimed to have communed with the likes of Plato, Galileo, Shakespeare, Dante, Jesus—and even the Devil himself. Hugo’s transcriptions of these conversations have all been published. Or so it was believed.Recovering from her own losses, mythologist Jac L’Etoile arrives on the Isle of Jersey—where Hugo conducted the séances—hoping to uncover a secret about the island’s Celtic roots. But the man who’s invited her there, a troubled soul named Theo Gaspard, has hopes she’ll help him discover something quite different—Hugo’s lost conversations with someone called the Shadow of the Sepulcher.What follows is an intricately plotted and atmospheric tale of suspense with a spellbinding ghost story at its heart.|Hardcover||373.0|May 7, 2013|Atria Books||||544.3104|3.78|4.4|1596|143.0|15.24|3.048|22.86|Historical Fiction|Fiction|Mystery|Historical|Paranormal|Fantasy|Suspense|Thriller|Supernatural|Gothic|0.3458445040214477|0.13136729222520108|0.12332439678284182|0.09651474530831099|0.08847184986595175|0.06970509383378018|0.05898123324396784|0.04289544235924933|0.021447721179624662|0.021447721179624662|353706.5

October Mourning: A Song for Matthew Shepard|Lesléa Newman|A masterful poetic exploration of the impact of Matthew Shepard’s murder on the world.On the night of October 6, 1998, a gay twenty-one-year-old college student named Matthew Shepard was lured from a Wyoming bar by two young men, savagely beaten, tied to a remote fence, and left to die. Gay Awareness Week was beginning at the University of Wyoming, and the keynote speaker was Lesléa Newman, discussing her book Heather Has Two Mommies. Shaken, the author addressed the large audience that gathered, but she remained haunted by Matthew’s murder. October Mourning, a novel in verse, is her deeply felt response to the events of that tragic day. Using her poetic imagination, the author creates fictitious monologues from various points of view, including the fence Matthew was tied to, the stars that watched over him, the deer that kept him company, and Matthew himself. More than a decade later, this stunning cycle of sixty-eight poems serves as an illumination for readers too young to remember, and as a powerful, enduring tribute to Matthew Shepard’s life.|Hardcover||111.0|September 25, 2012|Candlewick|14 - 17 years|NP|9 - 12|4354.4832|4.16|4.7|3973|78.0|13.8176|1.2954|23.8252|Poetry|Young Adult|LGBT|Historical Fiction|Queer|Realistic Fiction|Teen|Adult|Audiobook|Historical|0.5408560311284046|0.1621271076523995|0.1219195849546044|0.04409857328145266|0.02723735408560312|0.02594033722438392|0.023346303501945533|0.019455252918287938|0.018158236057068743|0.016861219195849545|80269.72

But then an unexpected gift wins him a scholarship to an exclusive boys’ school, and his life will never be the same again.As he enters into adulthood, Harry finally learns how his father really died, but the awful truth only leads him to question, was he even his father?

From the docks of working-class England to the bustling streets of 1940 New York City, Only Time Will Tell takes readers on a journey through to future volumes, which will bring to life one hundred years of recent history to reveal a family story that neither the reader nor Harry Clifton himself could ever have imagined."|Hardcover||386.0|August 30, 2011|St. Martin's Press||||589.6696|4.09|4.4|77498.0|9595.0|16.3576|3.3528|24.28240000000001|Fiction|Historical Fiction|Mystery|Thriller|Drama|Historical|Audiobook|Suspense|Novels|Crime|0.3571690502383572|0.2867620095342868|0.07407407407407407|0.06123945727906124|0.05793912724605794|0.04987165383204987|0.033736707004033736|0.03006967363403007|0.02566923359002567|0.02346901356802347|338403.28
Furiously Happy: A Funny Book About Horrible Things|Jenny  Lawson|"#1 New York Times BestsellerIn Furiously Happy, a humor memoir tinged with just enough tragedy and pathos to make it worthwhile, Jenny Lawson examines her own experience with severe depression and a host of other conditions, and explains how it has led her to live life to the fullest:""I've often thought that people with severe depression have developed such a well for experiencing extreme emotion that they might be able to experience extreme joy in a way that ‘normal people' also might never understand. And that's what Furiously Happy is all about.""Jenny’s readings are standing room only, with fans lining up to have Jenny sign their bottles of Xanax or Prozac as often as they are to have her sign their books. Furiously Happy appeals to Jenny's core fan base but also transcends it. There are so many people out there struggling with depression and mental illness, either themselves or someone in their family—and in Furiously Happy they will find a member of their tribe offering up an uplifting message (via a taxidermied roadkill raccoon). Let's Pretend This Never Happened ostensibly was about embracing your own weirdness, but deep down it was about family. Furiously Happy is about depression and mental illness, but deep down it's about joy—and who doesn't want a bit more of that?"|Hardcover||329.0|||||||3.89|4.5|138856.0|5420.0||||Nonfiction|Humor|Memoir|Audiobook|Biography|Mental Health|Mental Illness|Comedy|Biography Memoir|Essays|0.3272656478146598|0.1948797819526915|0.180181057140076|0.07845809403290177|0.05256497615107564|0.051396865569940615|0.03027353256108245|0.029981504915798693|0.028716051786235763|0.02628248807553782|187536.63
Very Sincerely Yours|Kerry Winfrey|"A charming and heartwarming new romantic comedy by the author of Waiting for Tom Hanks, Kerry Winfrey.
Teddy Phillips never thought she'd still be spending every day surrounded by toys at almost thirty years old. But working at a vintage toy store is pretty much all she has going on in her life after being unceremoniously dumped by her longtime boyfriend. The one joy that she's kept is her not-so-guilty pleasure: Everett's Place, a local children's show hosted by Everett St. James, a man whom Teddy finds very soothing . . . and, okay, cute.Teddy finds the courage to write to him, feeling slightly like one of the children who write to him on his show. He always gives sound advice and seems like he has everything figured out--and he pretty much does: Everett has a great support system, wonderful friends, and his dream job. But there's still that persistent feeling in the back of his mind that something's missing.When a woman named Theodora starts writing to Everett, he is drawn to her honesty and vulnerability. They continue writing to each other, all the while living their lives without meeting. When their worlds collide, however, they must both let go of their fears and figure out what they truly want--and if the future they want includes each other."|Paperback||384.0|June 15, 2021|Berkley||||4853.434399999999|4.35||60||13.97|2.3876|20.955|Romance|Contemporary|Adult|Chick Lit|Adult Fiction|Fiction|Contemporary Romance||||0.4186046511627907|0.1744186046511628|0.13953488372093026|0.09302325581395347|0.06976744186046513|0.05813953488372092|0.04651162790697674||||209192.13

Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune|Bill Dedman|When Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Bill Dedman noticed in 2009 a grand home for sale, unoccupied for nearly sixty years, he stumbled through a surprising portal into American history. Empty Mansions is a rich mystery of wealth and loss, connecting the Gilded Age opulence of the nineteenth century with a twenty-first-century battle over a $300 million inheritance. At its heart is a reclusive heiress named Huguette Clark, a woman so secretive that, at the time of her death at age 104, no new photograph of her had been seen in decades. Though she owned palatial homes in California, New York, and Connecticut, why had she lived for twenty years in a simple hospital room, despite being in excellent health? Why were her valuables being sold off? Was she in control of her fortune, or controlled by those managing her money?   Dedman has collaborated with Huguette Clark’s cousin, Paul Clark Newell, Jr., one of the few relatives to have frequent conversations with her. Dedman and Newell tell a fairy tale in reverse: the bright, talented daughter, born into a family of extreme wealth and privilege, who secrets herself away from the outside world.   Huguette was the daughter of self-made copper industrialist W. A. Clark, nearly as rich as Rockefeller in his day, a controversial senator, railroad builder, and founder of Las Vegas. She grew up in the largest house in New York City, a remarkable dwelling with 121 rooms for a family of four. She owned paintings by Degas and Renoir, a world-renowned Stradivarius violin, a vast collection of antique dolls. But wanting more than treasures, she devoted her wealth to buying gifts for friends and strangers alike, to quietly pursuing her own work as an artist, and to guarding the privacy she valued above all else.   The Clark family story spans nearly all of American history in three generations, from a log cabin in Pennsylvania to mining camps in the Montana gold rush, from backdoor politics in Washington to a distress call from an elegant Fifth Avenue apartment. The same Huguette who was touched by the terror attacks of 9/11 held a ticket nine decades earlier for a first-class stateroom on the second voyage of the Titanic. Empty Mansions reveals a complex portrait of the mysterious Huguette and her intimate circle. We meet her extravagant father, her publicity-shy mother, her star-crossed sister, her French boyfriend, her nurse who received more than $30 million in gifts, and the relatives fighting to inherit Huguette’s copper fortune. Richly illustrated with more than seventy photographs, Empty Mansions is an enthralling story of an eccentric of the highest order, a last jewel of the Gilded Age who lived life on her own terms.The No. 1 New York Times bestseller.

Yes, Chef|Marcus Samuelsson|It begins with a simple ritual: Every Saturday afternoon, a boy who loves to cook walks to his grandmother’s house and helps her prepare a roast chicken for dinner. The grandmother is Swedish, a retired domestic. The boy is Ethiopian and adopted, and he will grow up to become the world-renowned chef Marcus Samuelsson. This book is his love letter to food and family in all its manifestations.    Marcus Samuelsson was only three years old when he, his mother, and his sister—all battling tuberculosis—walked seventy-five miles to a hospital in the Ethiopian capital city of Addis Adaba. Tragically, his mother succumbed to the disease shortly after she arrived, but Marcus and his sister recovered, and one year later they were welcomed into a loving middle-class white family in Göteborg, Sweden. It was there that Marcus’s new grandmother, Helga, sparked in him a lifelong passion for food and cooking with her pan-fried herring, her freshly baked bread, and her signature roast chicken. From a very early age, there was little question what Marcus was going to be when he grew up.Yes, Chef chronicles Marcus Samuelsson’s remarkable journey from Helga’s humble kitchen to some of the most demanding and cutthroat restaurants in Switzerland and France, from his grueling stints on cruise ships to his arrival in New York City, where his outsize talent and ambition finally come together at Aquavit, earning him a coveted New York Times three-star rating at the age of twenty-four. But Samuelsson’s career of  “chasing flavors,” as he calls it, had only just begun—in the intervening years, there have been White House state dinners, career crises, reality show triumphs and, most important, the opening of the beloved Red Rooster in Harlem. At Red Rooster, Samuelsson has fufilled his dream of creating a truly diverse, multiracial dining room—a place where presidents and prime ministers rub elbows with jazz musicians, aspiring artists, bus drivers, and nurses. It is a place where an orphan from Ethiopia, raised in Sweden, living in America, can feel at home. With disarming honesty and intimacy, Samuelsson also opens up about his failures—the price of ambition, in human terms—and recounts his emotional journey, as a grown man, to meet the father he never knew. Yes, Chef is a tale of personal discovery, unshakable determination, and the passionate, playful pursuit of flavors—one man’s struggle to find a place for himself in the kitchen, and in the world.|Hardcover||319.0|June 26, 2012|Random House||||657.7084|3.84|4.6|16336|813.0|15.875|2.9718|24.1554|Memoir|Nonfiction|Food|Biography|Audiobook|Cooking|Biography Memoir|Foodie|Autobiography|Food Writing|0.24049217002237136|0.2382550335570469|0.2114093959731544|0.09619686800894854|0.05089485458612975|0.049217002237136466|0.03803131991051454|0.029082774049217|0.028523489932885907|0.017897091722595078|403947.26

Chanel Bonfire|Wendy Lawless|A stunning memoir about an actress's unconventional, heartbreaking childhood with an unstable alcoholic and suicidal mother — a real-life Holly Golightly turned Mommie Dearest — and the unusual strength that allowed her to rise above it all.By the time Wendy Lawless turned seventeen, she'd known for quite some time that she didn't have a normal mother. But that didn't stop her from wanting one.Georgann Rea didn't bake cookies or go to PTA meetings; she wore a mink coat and always had a lit Dunhill plugged into her cigarette holder. She had slept with too many men, and some women, and she didn't like dogs or children. Georgann had the ice queen beauty of a Hitchcock heroine and the cold heart to match.In this evocative, darkly humorous memoir, Wendy deftly charts the highs and lows of growing up with her younger sister in the shadow of an unstable, fabulously neglectful mother. Georgann, a real-life Holly Golightly who constantly reinvents herself as she trades up from trailer-park to penthouse, suffers multiple nervous breakdowns and suicide attempts, while Wendy tries to hide the cracks in their fractured family from the rest of the world.Chanel Bonfire depicts a childhood blazed through the refined aeries of The Dakota and the swinging townhouses of London, while the girls' beautiful but damned mother desperately searches for glamour and fulfillment. Ultimately, they must choose between living their own lives and being their mother's warden.|Hardcover||304.0|January 8, 2013|Gallery Books||||6259.5696|3.76|4.3|6122.0|328.0|13.97|2.7940000000000005|21.285200000000003|Memoir|Nonfiction|Biography|Biography Memoir|Mental Illness|Autobiography|Family|Adult|Coming Of Age|Psychology|0.3893805309734513|0.35103244837758113|0.08259587020648967|0.05309734513274336|0.032448377581120944|0.02359882005899705|0.02064896755162242|0.02064896755162242|0.014749262536873156|0.011799410029498523|308663.06

But so far, all she has to show for her efforts is a single line in an ad for ugly Christmas sweaters and a degrading waitressing job. She lives in Brooklyn with two roommates - Jane, her best friend from college, and Dan, a sci-fi writer, who is very definitely not boyfriend material - and is struggling with her feelings for a suspiciously charming guy in her acting class, all while trying to find a hair-product cocktail that actually works. Meanwhile, she dreams of doing ""important"" work, but only ever seems to get auditions for dishwashing liquid and peanut butter commercials. It's hard to tell if she'll run out of time or money first, but either way, failure would mean facing the fact that she has absolutely no skills to make it in the real world. Her father wants her to come home and teach, her agent won't call her back, and her classmate Penelope, who seems supportive, might just turn out to be her toughest competition yet. Someday, Someday, Maybe is a funny and charming debut about finding yourself, finding love, and, most difficult of all, finding an acting job."|Hardcover||340.0|April 30, 2013|Ballantine Books||||607.81328|3.52|4.4|49091|1591.0|16.1798|2.6416|23.876|Fiction|Chick Lit|Contemporary|Audiobook|Romance|Adult|Adult Fiction|Humor|New York|Realistic Fiction|0.3819960861056752|0.17142857142857146|0.10097847358121333|0.09080234833659492|0.07553816046966733|0.05088062622309197|0.04814090019569472|0.03874755381604697|0.02113502935420744|0.020352250489236792|339269.5

Doc|Mary Doria Russell|The year is 1878, peak of the Texas cattle trade. The place is Dodge City, Kansas, a saloon-filled cow town jammed with liquored-up adolescent cowboys and young Irish hookers. Violence is random and routine, but when the burned body of a mixed-blood boy named Johnnie Sanders is discovered, his death shocks a part-time policeman named Wyatt Earp. And it is a matter of strangely personal importance to Doc Holliday, the frail twenty-six-year-old dentist who has just opened an office at No. 24 Dodge House.Beautifully educated, born to the life of a Southern gentleman, Dr. John Henry Holliday is given an awful choice at the age of twenty-two: die within months in Atlanta or leave everyone and everything he loves in the hope that the dry air and sunshine of the West will restore him to health. Young, scared, lonely, and sick, he arrives on the Texas frontier just as an economic crash wrecks the dreams of a nation. Soon, with few alternatives open to him, Doc Holliday is gambling professionally; he is also living with Mária Katarina Harony, a high-strung Hungarian whore with dazzling turquoise eyes, who can quote Latin classics right back at him. Kate makes it her business to find Doc the high-stakes poker games that will support them both in high style. It is Kate who insists that the couple travel to Dodge City, because “that’s where the money is.” And that is where the unlikely friendship of Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp really begins—before Wyatt Earp is the prototype of the square-jawed, fearless lawman; before Doc Holliday is the quintessential frontier gambler; before the gunfight at the O.K. Corral links their names forever in American frontier mythology—when neither man wanted fame or deserved notoriety.Authentic, moving, and witty, Maria Doria Russell’s fifth novel redefines these two towering figures of the American West and brings to life an extraordinary cast of historical characters, including Holliday’s unforgettable companion, Kate. First and last, however, Doc is John Henry Holliday’s story, written with compassion, humor, and respect by one of our greatest contemporary storytellers.|Hardcover|First edition |394.0|May 3, 2011|Random House||||693.99576|3.96|4.5|15413.0|970.0|16.662399999999998|3.5306|24.3078|Historical Fiction|Fiction|Westerns|Historical|Audiobook|19th Century|American History|Adult|Adult Fiction|Novels|0.4841312533620226|0.19849381387842926|0.15814954276492738|0.06939214631522324|0.020441097364174286|0.017751479289940832|0.01613770844540075|0.013448090371167294|0.01183431952662722|0.010220548682087143|415496.86

The Man Who Quit Money|Mark Sundeen|"In 2000, Daniel Suelo left his life savings—all thirty dollars of it—in a phone booth. He has lived without money—and with a newfound sense of freedom and security—ever since. The Man Who Quit Money is an account of how one man learned to live, sanely and happily, without earning, receiving, or spending a single cent. Suelo doesn't pay taxes, or accept food stamps or welfare. He lives in caves in the Utah canyonlands, forages wild foods and gourmet discards. He no longer even carries an I.D. Yet he manages to amply fulfill not only the basic human needs—for shelter, food, and warmth—but, to an enviable degree, the universal desires for companionship, purpose, and spiritual engagement. By retracing the surprising path and guiding philosophy that led Suelo from an idealistic childhood through youthful disillusionment to his radical reinvention of ""the good life,"" Sundeen raises provocative and riveting questions about the decisions we all make—by default or by design—about how we live. The Man Who Quit Money inspires us to imagine how we might live better."|Paperback||260.0|March 6, 2012|Riverhead Books||||3628.736|3.74|4.2|2699|257.0|13.843|1.7779999999999998|20.828000000000007|Nonfiction|Biography|Philosophy|Memoir|Biography Memoir|Economics|Sociology|Money|Spirituality|Adventure|0.42955326460481097|0.21649484536082475|0.12027491408934707|0.048109965635738834|0.044673539518900345|0.03436426116838488|0.030927835051546393|0.027491408934707903|0.027491408934707903|0.020618556701030927|135563.43000000002

Crimson Ash|Douglas Calder|A brutal murder is committed, and left at the crime scene is a fingerprint belonging to the next victim, covered in the blood of the current one. Demwood, a small suburban city in Southern California, suffers from petty crime, speeding tickets, and little else. On the rare chance that a murder takes place, the crime is simple and obvious, usually a domestic dispute. Overall, Demwood is calm and content living in a bubble of safety and security. One night, however, a gruesome murder is discovered on a playground at the end of a cul-de-sac with the sand pit littered with body parts arranged into a cryptic symbol. The small city’s veil of safety is torn as Detective Rachel Rinzel tries to stop the string of murders. She excels at intellectual challenges, even receives a sense of euphoric feeling from solving difficult problems, but this case does not follow logical patterns. Rinzel feels lost for the first time in her career. The only lead that she can discover is a bloody fingerprint at the scene of the crime. What seems like the perfect evidence to convict only leads her to the next dismembered corpse and a different bloody fingerprint. This forces Rinzel to play defensively and anticipate the moves of the murderer. Why does the murderer leave clues for who the next victim is and what is the meaning behind the cryptic symbol left at the crime scenes?|Kindle Edition|||||||||5.0|4.2|3|3.0||||||||||||||||||||||||57603.63000000001

The two are drawn to each other and can't deny their growing feelings. But while Morgan--out and proud, and determined to have a fresh start--doesn't want to have to keep their budding relationship a secret, Ruby isn't ready to come out yet. With each girl on a different path toward living her truth, can they go the distance together?"|Hardcover||336.0|May 18, 2021|G.P.

The Filter Bubble: What the Internet is Hiding From You|Eli Pariser|"An eye-opening account of how the hidden rise of personalization on the Internet is controlling - and limiting - the information we consume.In December 2009, Google began customizing its search results for each user. Instead of giving you the most broadly popular result, Google now tries to predict what you are most likely to click on. According to MoveOn.org board president Eli Pariser, Google's change in policy is symptomatic of the most significant shift to take place on the Web in recent years - the rise of personalization. In this groundbreaking investigation of the new hidden Web, Pariser uncovers how this growing trend threatens to control how we consume and share information as a society-and reveals what we can do about it.Though the phenomenon has gone largely undetected until now, personalized filters are sweeping the Web, creating individual universes of information for each of us. Facebook - the primary news source for an increasing number of Americans - prioritizes the links it believes will appeal to you so that if you are a liberal, you can expect to see only progressive links. Even an old-media bastion like ""The Washington Post"" devotes the top of its home page to a news feed with the links your Facebook friends are sharing. Behind the scenes a burgeoning industry of data companies is tracking your personal information to sell to advertisers, from your political leanings to the color you painted your living room to the hiking boots you just browsed on Zappos.In a personalized world, we will increasingly be typed and fed only news that is pleasant, familiar, and confirms our beliefs - and because these filters are invisible, we won't know what is being hidden from us. Our past interests will determine what we are exposed to in the future, leaving less room for the unexpected encounters that spark creativity, innovation, and the democratic exchange of ideas.While we all worry that the Internet is eroding privacy or shrinking our attention spans, Pariser uncovers a more pernicious and far-reaching trend on the Internet and shows how we can - and must - change course. With vivid detail and remarkable scope, The Filter Bubble reveals how personalization undermines the Internet's original purpose as an open platform for the spread of ideas and could leave us all in an isolated, echoing world."|Hardcover||294.0|May 12, 2011|Penguin Press||||7121.394399999999|3.79|4.4|5107.0|219.0|14.605|3.175|21.59|Nonfiction|Technology|Science|Business|Internet|Psychology|Politics|Sociology|Cultural|Social Media|0.4348341232227488|0.20734597156398105|0.07938388625592417|0.06635071090047394|0.06635071090047394|0.04265402843601896|0.031990521327014215|0.030805687203791468|0.023696682464454968|0.016587677725118485|330174.19

The Secret Life of Violet Grant|Beatriz Williams|Passion, redemption, and a battered suitcase full of secrets: the New York Times-bestselling author of A Hundred Summers returns with another engrossing tale.Manhattan, 1964. Vivian Schuyler, newly graduated from Bryn Mawr College, has recently defied the privilege of her storied old Fifth Avenue family to do the unthinkable for a budding Kennedy-era socialite: break into the Mad Men world of razor-stylish Metropolitan magazine. But when she receives a bulky overseas parcel in the mail, the unexpected contents draw her inexorably back into her family’s past, and the hushed-over crime passionnel of an aunt she never knew, whose existence has been wiped from the record of history.Berlin, 1914. Violet Schuyler Grant endures her marriage to the philandering and decades-older scientist Dr. Walter Grant for one reason: for all his faults, he provides the necessary support to her liminal position as a young American female physicist in prewar Germany. The arrival of Dr. Grant’s magnetic former student at the beginning of Europe’s fateful summer interrupts this delicate détente. Lionel Richardson, a captain in the British Army, challenges Violet to escape her husband’s perverse hold, and as the world edges into war and Lionel’s shocking true motives become evident, Violet is tempted to take the ultimate step to set herself free and seek a life of her own conviction with a man whose cause is as audacious as her own.As the iridescent and fractured Vivian digs deeper into her aunt’s past and the mystery of her ultimate fate, Violet’s story of determination and desire unfolds, shedding light on the darkness of her years abroad . . . and teaching Vivian to reach forward with grace for the ambitious future––and the love––she wants most.|Hardcover||432.0|May 27, 2014|G.P.

Lawrence in Arabia: War, Deceit, Imperial Folly, and the Making of the Modern Middle East|Scott Anderson|A thrilling and revelatory narrative of one of the most epic and consequential periods in 20th century history – the Arab Revolt and the secret “great game” to control the Middle East       The Arab Revolt against the Turks in World War One was, in the words of T.E. Lawrence, “a sideshow of a sideshow.”  Amidst the slaughter in European trenches, the Western combatants paid scant attention to the Middle Eastern theater.  As a result, the conflict was shaped to a remarkable degree by a small handful of adventurers and low-level officers far removed from the corridors of power.   Curt Prüfer was an effete academic attached to the German embassy in Cairo, whose clandestine role was to foment Islamic jihad against British rule.  Aaron Aaronsohn was a renowned agronomist and committed Zionist who gained the trust of the Ottoman governor of Syria. William Yale was the fallen scion of the American aristocracy, who traveled the Ottoman Empire on behalf of Standard Oil, dissembling to the Turks in order gain valuable oil concessions.  At the center of it all was Lawrence.  In early 1914 he was an archaeologist excavating ruins in the sands of Syria; by 1917 he was the most romantic figure of World War One, battling both the enemy and his own government to bring about the vision he had for the Arab people. The intertwined paths of these four men – the schemes they put in place, the battles they fought, the betrayals they endured and committed – mirror the grandeur, intrigue and tragedy of the war in the desert.  Prüfer became Germany’s grand spymaster in the Middle East.  Aaronsohn constructed an elaborate Jewish spy-ring in Palestine, only to have the anti-Semitic and bureaucratically-inept British first ignore and then misuse his organization, at tragic personal cost.  Yale would become the only American intelligence agent in the entire Middle East – while still secretly on the payroll of Standard Oil.  And the enigmatic Lawrence rode into legend at the head of an Arab army, even as he waged secret war against his own nation’s imperial ambitions. Based on years of intensive primary document research, LAWRENCE IN ARABIA definitively overturns received wisdom on how the modern Middle East was formed.  Sweeping in its action, keen in its portraiture, acid in its condemnation of the destruction wrought by European colonial plots, this is a book that brilliantly captures the way in which the folly of the past creates the anguish of the present.|Hardcover||577.0|August 6, 2013|Doubleday||||997.9024|4.02|4.6|14784.0|1981.0|16.3322|4.2672|24.2316|History|Nonfiction|Biography|Politics|War|World War I|Military Fiction|Historical|World History|Audiobook|0.4641148325358852|0.23923444976076555|0.11435406698564593|0.04784688995215311|0.03971291866028708|0.027751196172248804|0.018660287081339717|0.01770334928229665|0.016267942583732056|0.014354066985645932|477864.7
Building Stories|Chris Ware|After years of sporadic work on other books and projects and following the almost complete loss of his virility, it's here: a new graphic novel by Chris Ware. Building Stories imagines the inhabitants of a three-story Chicago apartment building: a 30-something woman who has yet to find someone with whom to spend the rest of her life; a couple, possibly married, who wonder if they can bear each other's company another minute; and the building's landlady, an elderly woman who has lived alone for decades. Taking advantage of the absolute latest advances in wood pulp technology, Building Stories is a book with no deliberate beginning nor end, the scope, ambition, artistry and emotional prevarication beyond anything yet seen from this artist or in this medium, probably for good reason.|Hardcover||260.0|October 2, 2012|Pantheon||||2744.2316|4.31|4.6|6628|459.0|29.718000000000004|4.8768|42.418|Graphic Novels|Comics|Fiction|Art|Short Stories|Graphic Novels Comics|Comix|Contemporary|Architecture|Comic Book|0.4421315570358035|0.2631140716069942|0.1357202331390508|0.0424646128226478|0.03164029975020816|0.030807660283097418|0.01582014987510408|0.014987510407993341|0.013322231473771855|0.009991673605328892|621945.96

Swamplandia!|Karen Russell|From the celebrated twenty-nine-year-old author of the everywhere-heralded short-story collection St. Lucy’s Home for Girls Raised by Wolves comes a blazingly original debut novel that takes us back to the swamps of the Florida Everglades, and introduces us to Ava Bigtree, an unforgettable young heroine.The Bigtree alligator-wrestling dynasty is in decline, and Swamplandia!, their island home and gator-wrestling theme park, formerly #1 in the region, is swiftly being encroached upon by a fearsome and sophisticated competitor called the World of Darkness. Ava’s mother, the park’s indomitable headliner, has just died; her sister, Ossie, has fallen in love with a spooky character known as the Dredgeman, who may or may not be an actual ghost; and her brilliant big brother, Kiwi, who dreams of becoming a scholar, has just defected to the World of Darkness in a last-ditch effort to keep their family business from going under. Ava’s father, affectionately known as Chief Bigtree, is AWOL; and that leaves Ava, a resourceful but terrified thirteen, to manage ninety-eight gators and the vast, inscrutable landscape of her own grief. Against a backdrop of hauntingly fecund plant life animated by ancient lizards and lawless hungers, Karen Russell has written an utterly singular novel about a family’s struggle to stay afloat in a world that is inexorably sinking. An arrestingly beautiful and inventive work from a vibrant new voice in fiction.|Hardcover||323.0|February 1, 2011|Knopf||||612.3492|3.28|3.7|55452.0|928.0|16.738599999999998|3.302|24.2062|Fiction|Magical Realism|Fantasy|Literary Fiction|Contemporary|Novels|Adult Fiction|Coming Of Age|Book Club|Adult|0.5442950706652878|0.09927611168562564|0.06377111340916926|0.05653223026542571|0.05653223026542571|0.048603929679420885|0.03722854188210962|0.033092037228541885|0.0317132023440193|0.02895553257497415|283975.79000000004
Mortality|Christopher Hitchens|"On June 8, 2010, while on a book tour for his bestselling memoir, Hitch-22, Christopher Hitchens was stricken in his New York hotel room with excruciating pain in his chest and thorax. As he would later write in the first of a series of award-winning columns for ""Vanity Fair,"" he suddenly found himself being deported ""from the country of the well across the stark frontier that marks off the land of malady."" Over the next eighteen months, until his death in Houston on December 15, 2011, he wrote constantly and brilliantly on politics and culture, astonishing readers with his capacity for superior work even in extremis.Throughout the course of his ordeal battling esophageal cancer, Hitchens adamantly and bravely refused the solace of religion, preferring to confront death with both eyes open. In this account of his affliction, he describes the torments of illness, discusses its taboos, and explores how disease transforms experience and changes our relationship to the world around us. By turns personal and philosophical, Hitchens embraces the full panoply of human emotions as cancer invades his body and compels him to grapple with the enigma of mortality."|Hardcover||104.0|September 1, 2012|Twelve||||4717.3568|4.08|4.5|25222|1471.0|13.462|1.7779999999999998|19.812|Nonfiction|Philosophy|Memoir|Biography|Essays|Religion|Death|Atheism|Biography Memoir|Autobiography|0.3637759017651573|0.18188795088257867|0.1108979278587874|0.09478127398311588|0.06139677666922486|0.05986185725249425|0.03760552570990023|0.03645433614735226|0.029930928626247126|0.023407521105141986|93840.5

Not Taco Bell Material|Adam Carolla|"In his second book, Adam Carolla — author of New York Times bestseller In Fifty Years We'll All Be Chicks and chart-topping podcaster — reveals all the stories behind how he came to be the angry middle-aged man he is today. Funnyman Adam Carolla is known for two things: hilarious rants about things that drive him crazy and personal stories about everything from his hardscrabble childhood to his slacker friends to the hypocrisy of Hollywood. He tackled rants in his first book, and now he tells his best stories and debuts some never-before-heard tales as well. Organized by the myriad ""dumps"" Carolla called home — through the flophouse apartments he rented in his twenties, up to the homes he personally renovated after achieving success in Hollywood — the anecdotes here follow Adam's journey and the hilarious pitfalls along the way. Adam Carolla started broke and blue collar and has now been on the Hollywood scene for over fifteen years, yet he never lost his underdog demeanor. He's still connected to the working class guy he once was, and delivers a raw and edgy, fish-out-of-water take on the world he lives in (but mostly disagrees with), telling all the stories, no matter who he offends — family, friends or the famous."|Hardcover||336.0|June 12, 2012|Crown Archetype||||576.0618400000002|3.76|4.4|5406|805.0|16.2052|3.0226|24.638|Humor|Nonfiction|Biography|Comedy|Memoir|Audiobook|Biography Memoir|Autobiography|Comedian|Politics|0.363013698630137|0.2089041095890411|0.1095890410958904|0.09246575342465753|0.08904109589041095|0.0410958904109589|0.0410958904109589|0.030821917808219176|0.0136986301369863|0.010273972602739724|216843.74
The Painted Girls|Cathy Marie Buchanan|"1878 Paris. Following their father's sudden death, the van Goethem sisters find their lives upended. Without his wages, and with the small amount their laundress mother earns disappearing into the absinthe bottle, eviction from their lodgings seems imminent. With few options for work, Marie is dispatched to the Paris Opéra, where for a scant seventeen francs a week, she will be trained to enter the famous ballet. Her older sister, Antoinette, finds work as an extra in a stage adaptation of Émile Zola's naturalist masterpiece L'Assommoir.

The Book of True Believer|M. Funk|“Life is a marvelous concoction of endings and beginnings laced up in ribbons of fantasy and fairy tale . . .”It’s been nearly three years since Pentecostal faith healer Jeremiah Promise and secular free-spirit True Believer first met—nearly three years since he laid hands and miraculously cured her of terminal cancer. A lot has happened since then: Jeremiah’s former ministry partner has been imprisoned for fraud, Jeremiah’s reputation has been destroyed, and his faith in God and sense of moral idealism have been shattered.To True, it seems like supreme destiny when Jeremiah Promise shows up in her small town of Luck, WI, to perform one final healing Crusade before quitting the miracle business for good. True’s total faith in Jeremiah’s divine gifts and her determination to do “something grand” with the rest of her life prove infectious. She quickly inspires Jeremiah to start fresh with a new ministry partner by his side.Doors miraculously open for them, and all seems right with the world as Jeremiah and True set out to construct a new faith-healing empire. True’s life is finally on the right path . . . or so she thinks. When Jeremiah’s veneer of moral infallibility slowly rolls back to reveal inconsistencies beneath, True discovers that she may have a difficult choice to make between love and integrity.The Book of True Believer: A political allegory about love, empathy, pain, and power.|Paperback|||October 30, 2020|Local Color Books LLC||||5715.2592|3.78|4.8|9|15.0|13.97|1.7779999999999998|21.59|||||||||||||||||||||230847.63

As Aomame’s and Tengo’s narratives converge over the course of this single year, we learn of the profound and tangled connections that bind them ever closer: a beautiful, dyslexic teenage girl with a unique vision; a mysterious religious cult that instigated a shoot-out with the metropolitan police; a reclusive, wealthy dowager who runs a shelter for abused women; a hideously ugly private investigator; a mild-mannered yet ruthlessly efficient bodyguard; and a peculiarly insistent television-fee collector.A love story, a mystery, a fantasy, a novel of self-discovery, a dystopia to rival George Orwell’s — 1Q84 is Haruki Murakami’s most ambitious undertaking yet: an instant best seller in his native Japan, and a tremendous feat of imagination from one of our most revered contemporary writers.|Hardcover||925.0|October 25, 2011|Knopf||||1292.7372|3.92|4.4|216997.0|3218.0|16.51|4.7752|23.9522|Fiction|Fantasy|Magical Realism|Japan|Science Fiction|Japanese Literature|Contemporary|Literature|Novels|Dystopia|0.4090540174948147|0.16060961313012895|0.09252412300477952|0.08224366489313735|0.07079087383893949|0.058616647127784284|0.03913788438993597|0.03228424564884118|0.030390477049328162|0.0243484534223104|317469.63
This Little Light|Lori Lansens|An urgent bulletin from an all-too-believable near future where a smart young woman who questions the new world order is accused of being a terrorist—an intense, unputdownable read by the author of The Girls   Taking place over the course of 48 hours in 2024, This Little Light draws readers into a universe of born-again Christians and celebrity worship where abortion is once again illegal and both religion and surveillance run amok. Heroine Rory Miller and her best friend, Fee, are on the run after a bomb explodes at their elite Christian private school in their triple-gated California community during their American Chastity Ball, where girls in white gowns pledge to their fathers that they will remain virgins until marriage. As the girls struggle to survive while following their own attempted capture on social media and cable news—crowdsourced by Christian zealots and bounty hunters—Rory blogs their story in real time, determined to leave behind a record in their own words in case they don’t make it out alive.   In This Little Light, bestselling author Lori Lansens weaves together the pressing issues of our time—women’s rights, income disparity, religion and politics, immigration—and di˝ uses them through the authentic voice of a 16-year-old navigating a frightening reality. The result is an intense, urgent, and enthralling read about an all-too-believable near future—and the world we already live in.|Hardcover||288.0|August 11, 2020|Harry N.

Kosher Chinese: Living, Teaching, and Eating with China's Other Billion|Michael     Levy|"An irreverent tale of an American Jew serving in the Peace Corps in rural China, which reveals the absurdities, joys, and pathos of a traditional society in fluxIn September of 2005, the Peace Corps sent Michael Levy to teach English in the heart of China's heartland. His hosts in the city of Guiyang found additional uses for him: resident expert on Judaism, romantic adviser, and provincial basketball star, to name a few. His account of overcoming vast cultural differences to befriend his students and fellow teachers is by turns poignant and laugh-out-loud funny.While reveling in the peculiarities of life in China's interior, the author also discovered that the ""other billion"" (people living far from the coastal cities covered by the American media) have a complex relationship with both their own traditions and the rapid changes of modernization. Lagging behind in China's economic boom, they experience the darker side of ""capitalism with Chinese characteristics,"" daily facing the schizophrenia of conflicting ideologies.Kosher Chinese is an illuminating account of the lives of the residents of Guiyang, particularly the young people who will soon control the fate of the world."|Paperback||256.0|July 5, 2011|Holt Paperbacks||||3492.6584|3.86|4.4|1180.0|99.0|13.335|1.6256000000000002|20.32|China|Nonfiction|Travel|Memoir|Asia|Jewish|Biography|Humor|Food|Religion|0.2518518518518518|0.2148148148148148|0.1851851851851852|0.1259259259259259|0.05555555555555555|0.04814814814814815|0.04444444444444445|0.02962962962962963|0.022222222222222227|0.022222222222222227|235756.21

More or less.Sworn to serve and protect the United States of America from all monsters by one of the country’s founding fathers, Franks has only one condition to the agreement: no matter what the government learns of him, no matter what is discovered concerning his odd physiology or the alchemy behind the elixir that made him, the government is never, ever allowed to try and make more like him. Such is absolutely forbidden and should the powers-that-be do so, then the agreement is null and void. Project Nemesis: in a secret location, using sophisticated technology and advanced genetic engineering, the director of the very agency Franks works for is making more like him. And the director is not content with making one. Nope, he’s making thirteen.Now all bets are off, and Hell hath no fury like a monster betrayed.

Love, an Index|Rebecca Lindenberg|A man disappears. The woman who loves him is left scarred and haunted. In her fierce, one-of-a-kind debut, Rebecca Lindenberg tells the story—in verse—of her passionate relationship with Craig Arnold, a much-respected poet who disappeared in 2009 while hiking a volcano in Japan. Lindenberg’s billowing, I-contain-multitudes style lays bare the poet’s sadnesses, joys, and longings in poems that are lyric and narrative, at once plainspoken and musically elaborate.Regarding her role in Arnold’s story, Lindenberg writes with clear-eyed humility and endearing dignity: “The girl with the ink-stained teeth / knows she’s famous / in a tiny, tragic way. / She’s not / daft, after all.” And then later, playfully, of her travels in Italy with the poet, her lover: “The carabinieri / wanted to know if there were bears / in our part of America. Yes, we said, / many bears. Man-eating bears? Yes, of course, / many man-eating bears.” Every poem in this collection bursts with humor, pathos, verve—and an utterly unique, soulful voice.This widely anticipated debut, already selected as a finalist for several prominent book awards, marks the first collection in the newly minted McSweeney’s Poetry Series. MPS is an imprint which seeks to publish a broad range of excellent new poetry collections in exquisitely designed hardcovers—poetry that’s useful and meaningful to anyone in any walk of life.|Hardcover|McSweeney's Poetry Series|96.0|March 20, 2012|McSweeney's Publishing||||4535.92|4.3|4.4|677|31.0|16.0274|1.3970000000000002|21.463|Poetry|Romance|Fiction|Love|Novels||||||0.9328621908127208|0.024734982332155483|0.024734982332155483|0.01060070671378092|0.00706713780918728||||||194899.5

To a Mountain in Tibet|Colin Thubron|The mountain path is the road of the dead,� writes Thubron (Shadow of the Silk Road) in this engrossing and affecting travel memoir that transcends the mere physical journey. In the wake of his mother's death, Thubron sets off to Mount Kailas in Tibet, a peak sacred to one-fifth of the world's population and the source of four of India's great rivers. Kailas has never been climbed: the slopes are important to Tibetan Buddhists who say the mountain's guardian is Demchog (a tantric variant of Shiva). Along with two guides, Thubron embarks on a pilgrimage that begins in Nepal and crosses into Tibet, recounting not only his arduous journey but also the political and cultural history of Tibet and the West's continued fascination with its mysticism. Along the way, he observes pilgrims of various religions converging on Kailas and the myriad monasteries, most of which were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and rebuilt decades later. It is the poignant evocations of his mother and sister (who died at 21), interwoven with his profound respect for the Tibetan culture and landscape that make Thubron's memoir an utterly moving read. - Publisher's Weekly|Hardcover||240.0|March 1, 2011|Harper||||5443.103999999998|3.62|4.3|2012.0|159.0|13.97|2.1590000000000003|20.955|Travel|Nonfiction|Asia|Memoir|Buddhism|Religion|China|Spirituality|Biography|Adventure|0.4883116883116883|0.21298701298701292|0.05974025974025974|0.05194805194805195|0.044155844155844164|0.03116883116883117|0.03116883116883117|0.028571428571428567|0.025974025974025976|0.025974025974025976|113907.93

I Can’t Believe How Well It’s Going: Essays|Robert Imbeault|From critically acclaimed, #1 Amazon Bestselling author Robert Imbeault comes I Can’t Believe How Well It’s Going: Essays—a brand- new collection of essays filled with stories of questionable decision making, biased observations, and sincere vulnerability.TL;DR? If you want to laugh, buy this book. In I Can’t Believe How Well It’s Going, I will regale you with tales of stand-up comedy, a lifelong skirmish with religion, and losing my shit during a 10-day silent meditation retreat. I whine about losing a friendship because I was an asshole, discovering I had an older sibling after forty-five years, and how an interview with an author of erotica changed the way I view porn. I explain why I trained in a boxing club for over a decade to never actually fight, how changing a diaper at thirty-thousand feet went very wrong, and how a May-September romance went right. I also share something incredibly personal. If this is uninteresting to you, then there is no need to read this book, but I still hope you do because it might make you laugh. There’s definitely science that proves laughing helps reduce stress, and reducing stress can help improve and even save your life, which means that science supports the claim that reading my book might save your life. But if you hate the book and don’t laugh, you might want to tell people how much you hate it, which gives you purpose. Science also maintains that having a purpose helps reduce stress, and reducing stress can help improve and even save your life, which means that there’s even more science to support the claim that reading my book might save your life.

The Book of Unknown Americans|Cristina Henriquez|A dazzling, heartbreaking page-turner destined for breakout status: a novel that gives voice to millions of Americans as it tells the story of the love between a Panamanian boy and a Mexican girl: teenagers living in an apartment block of immigrant families like their own.After their daughter Maribel suffers a near-fatal accident, the Riveras leave México and come to America. But upon settling at Redwood Apartments, a two-story cinderblock complex just off a highway in Delaware, they discover that Maribel's recovery--the piece of the American Dream on which they've pinned all their hopes--will not be easy. Every task seems to confront them with language, racial, and cultural obstacles.At Redwood also lives Mayor Toro, a high school sophomore whose family arrived from Panamá fifteen years ago. Mayor sees in Maribel something others do not: that beyond her lovely face, and beneath the damage she's sustained, is a gentle, funny, and wise spirit. But as the two grow closer, violence casts a shadow over all their futures in America.Peopled with deeply sympathetic characters, this poignant yet unsentimental tale of young love tells a riveting story of unflinching honesty and humanity that offers a resonant new definition of what it means to be an American.

1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created|Charles C. Mann|From the author of 1491—the best-selling study of the pre-Columbian Americas—a deeply engaging new history of the most momentous biological event since the death of the dinosaurs. More than 200 million years ago, geological forces split apart the continents. Isolated from each other, the two halves of the world developed radically different suites of plants and animals. When Christopher Columbus set foot in the Americas, he ended that separation at a stroke. Driven by the economic goal of establishing trade with China, he accidentally set off an ecological convulsion as European vessels carried thousands of species to new homes across the oceans. The Columbian Exchange, as researchers call it, is the reason there are tomatoes in Italy, oranges in Florida, chocolates in Switzerland, and chili peppers in Thailand. More important, creatures the colonists knew nothing about hitched along for the ride. Earthworms, mosquitoes, and cockroaches; honeybees, dandelions, and African grasses; bacteria, fungi, and viruses; rats of every description—all of them rushed like eager tourists into lands that had never seen their like before, changing lives and landscapes across the planet. Eight decades after Columbus, a Spaniard named Legazpi succeeded where Columbus had failed. He sailed west to establish continual trade with China, then the richest, most powerful country in the world. In Manila, a city Legazpi founded, silver from the Americas, mined by African and Indian slaves, was sold to Asians in return for silk for Europeans. It was the first time that goods and people from every corner of the globe were connected in a single worldwide exchange. Much as Columbus created a new world biologically, Legazpi and the Spanish empire he served created a new world economically.As Charles C. Mann shows, the Columbian Exchange underlies much of subsequent human history. Presenting the latest research by ecologists, anthropologists, archaeologists, and historians, Mann shows how the creation of this worldwide network of ecological and economic exchange fostered the rise of Europe, devastated imperial China, convulsed Africa, and for two centuries made Mexico City—where Asia, Europe, and the new frontier of the Americas dynamically interacted—the center of the world. In such encounters, he uncovers the germ of today’s fiercest political disputes, from immigration to trade policy to culture wars.In 1493, Charles Mann gives us an eye-opening scientific interpretation of our past, unequaled in its authority and fascination|Hardcover||557.0|August 9, 2011|Knopf||||952.5432|4.1|4.6|16636.0|1116.0|16.764|4.191|24.384|History|Nonfiction|Science|American History|Anthropology|World History|Economics|Historical|Audiobook|Environment|0.5836834733893558|0.242296918767507|0.040266106442577033|0.032563025210084036|0.025210084033613446|0.024859943977591042|0.014705882352941175|0.014705882352941175|0.012955182072829129|0.008753501400560224|750724.0
The Witness|Nora Roberts|Daughter of a controlling mother, Elizabeth finally let loose one night, drinking at a nightclub and allowing a strange man's seductive Russian accent lure her to a house on Lake Shore Drive. The events that followed changed her life forever. Twelve years later, the woman known as Abigail Lowery lives on the outskirts of a small town in the Ozarks. A freelance programmer, she designs sophisticated security systems -- and supplements her own security with a fierce dog and an assortment of firearms. She keeps to herself, saying little, revealing nothing. But Abigail's reserve only intrigues police chief Brooks Gleason. Her logical mind, her secretive nature, and her unromantic viewpoints leave him fascinated but frustrated.

I Love a Broad Margin to My Life|Maxine Hong Kingston|"In her singular voice—humble, elegiac, practical—Maxine Hong Kingston sets out to reflect on aging as she turns sixty-five. Kingston’s swift, effortlessly flowing verse lines feel instantly natural in this fresh approach to the art of memoir, as she circles from present to past and back, from lunch with a writer friend to the funeral of a Vietnam veteran, from her long marriage (“can’t divorce until we get it right. / Love, that is. Get love right”) to her arrest at a peace march in Washington, where she and her ""sisters"" protested the Iraq war in the George W. Bush years. Kingston embraces Thoreau’s notion of a “broad margin,” hoping to expand her vista: “I’m standing on top of a hill; / I can see everywhichway— / the long way that I came, and the few / places I have yet to go. Treat / my whole life as if it were a day.”On her journeys as writer, peace activist, teacher, and mother, Kingston revisits her most beloved characters: she learns the final fate of her Woman Warrior, and she takes her Tripmaster Monkey, a hip Chinese American, on a journey through China, where he has never been—a trip that becomes a beautiful meditation on the country then and now, on a culture where rice farmers still work in the age-old way, even as a new era is dawning. “All over China,” she writes, “and places where Chinese are, populations / are on the move, going home. That home / where Mother and Father are buried. Doors / between heaven and earth open wide.”Such is the spirit of this wonderful book—a sense of doors opening wide onto an American life of great purpose and joy, and the tonic wisdom of a writer we have come to cherish."|Hardcover||240.0|January 18, 2011|Knopf||||6531.7248|3.74|4.6|219.0|15.0|14.9606|2.4384|20.955|Poetry|Memoir|Nonfiction|Biography|Autobiography|China|||||0.4225352112676056|0.22535211267605634|0.14084507042253522|0.1267605633802817|0.056338028169014086|0.028169014084507043|||||354428.3500000001

The Future of the Mind: The Scientific Quest to Understand, Enhance, and Empower the Mind|Michio Kaku|"The New York Times best-selling author of Physics of the Impossible, Physics of the Future and Hyperspace tackles the most fascinating and complex object in the known universe: the human brain. For the first time in history, the secrets of the living brain are being revealed by a battery of high tech brain scans devised by physicists. Now what was once solely the province of science fiction has become a startling reality. Recording memories, telepathy, videotaping our dreams, mind control, avatars, and telekinesis are not only possible; they already exist. The Future of the Mind gives us an authoritative and compelling look at the astonishing research being done in top laboratories around the world—all based on the latest advancements in neuroscience and physics. One day we might have a ""smart pill"" that can enhance our cognition; be able to upload our brain to a computer, neuron for neuron; send thoughts and emotions around the world on a ""brain-net""; control computers and robots with our mind; push the very limits of immortality; and perhaps even send our consciousness across the universe.  Dr. Kaku takes us on a grand tour of what the future might hold, giving us not only a solid sense of how the brain functions but also how these technologies will change our daily lives. He even presents a radically new way to think about ""consciousness"" and applies it to provide fresh insight into mental illness, artificial intelligence and alien consciousness. With Dr. Kaku's deep understanding of modern science and keen eye for future developments, The Future of the Mind is a scientific tour de force--an extraordinary, mind-boggling exploration of the frontiers of neuroscience."|Hardcover||377.0|February 25, 2014|Doubleday||||716.67536|4.08|4.6|13044.0|1269.0|16.383|3.4036000000000004|24.1554|Science|Nonfiction|Psychology|Neuroscience|Physics|Philosophy|Audiobook|Brain|Biology|Technology|0.4510135135135135|0.26140202702702703|0.09797297297297296|0.055320945945945936|0.03927364864864865|0.02153716216216216|0.020270270270270268|0.019847972972972968|0.019003378378378386|0.014358108108108109|294659.17
Electric Barracuda|Tim Dorsey|"An alternate cover edition for this ISBN can be found here.Serge Storms, that loveable thermonuclear vigilante and one-stop-Florida-trivia-shop, has been leaving corpses strewn across the Sunshine State for more than a decade. The authorities—especially one tenacious state agent—have begun to notice the exponential body count, and send a police task force to track down Serge. Could his luck finally have run out?Meanwhile, armed with his perpetually baked sidekick, Coleman, Serge decides to blitz the state and resurrect his Internet travel-advice website—which, of course, must be the finest and the final word on trekking the Sunshine State. To up the ante, Serge concocts a theme vacation for his cyberspace audience. And that theme? You, too, can experience Florida through the eyes of a fugitive.Off they go blogging along a getaway route through the state's most remote bayous, back roads, and bars, where the number of cadavers begin stacking up like Serge's website hits. And in the middle of all his make-believe close brushes, Serge finally wises up to his pursuers and realizes that the manic gumball rally is genuinely on ""in the tradition of the great American chase movie.""Clues and questions mount:Who are all the women being photographed naked in the swamp?What made Coleman draw on his face with magic markers?Where is the cruise-to-nowhere taking its drunk prisoners?When was the last time a Civil War reenactment involved a sports car?But Serge also has some personal business to tidy up. His grandfather's old Miami Beach gang suddenly had their life savings wiped out, and there's a good bet it was no accident. Too much action for Serge to juggle? Not when it all dovetails nicely into his Secret Master Plan. And especially if it involves Serge's favorite new obsession: tracking Al Capone's little-known escapades in the Everglades.So gas up the car, say good-bye to the relatives, and join Serge on the lam as he drives straight for the deepest bowels of Florida to unravel the final mysteries of Electric Barracuda."|Hardcover||357.0|January 25, 2011|William Morrow||||707.60352|4.12|4.6|2324.0|224.0|15.24|2.9718|22.86|Mystery|Fiction|Humor|Crime|Comedy|Suspense|Thriller|Adventure|The United States Of America|Noir|0.2727272727272727|0.2348484848484849|0.2272727272727273|0.08333333333333333|0.08333333333333333|0.030303030303030307|0.022727272727272728|0.015151515151515154|0.015151515151515154|0.015151515151515154|288595.63

The Lover's Dictionary|David Levithan|basis, n.There has to be a moment at the beginning when you wonder whether you're in love with the person or in love with the feeling of love itself.If the moment doesn't pass, that's it―you're done. And if the moment does pass, it never goes that far. It stands in the distance, ready for whenever you want it back. Sometimes it's even there when you thought you were searching for something else, like an escape route, or your lover's face.How does one talk about love? Do we even have the right words to describe something that can be both utterly mundane and completely transcendent, pulling us out of our everyday lives and making us feel a part of something greater than ourselves? Taking a unique approach to this problem, the nameless narrator of David Levithan's The Lover's Dictionary has constructed the story of his relationship as a dictionary. Through these short entries, he provides an intimate window into the great events and quotidian trifles of being within a couple, giving us an indelible and deeply moving portrait of love in our time.|Hardcover||211.0|1 i|Farrar, Straus and Giroux||800L||4717.3568|3.88|4.5|43909.0|436.0|13.6906|2.1590000000000003|20.1168|Romance|Fiction|Contemporary|Young Adult|Poetry|Adult|Adult Fiction|Realistic Fiction|Love|Relationships|0.254719808210968|0.2307461792028768|0.13035660773149535|0.12556188192987713|0.0958945160323644|0.048846269103985616|0.04345220257716512|0.027270002996703627|0.02637099190890021|0.01678154030566377|270693.75

A Discovery of Witches|Deborah Harkness|A richly inventive novel about a centuries-old vampire, a spellbound witch, and the mysterious manuscript that draws them together. Deep in the stacks of Oxford's Bodleian Library, young scholar Diana Bishop unwittingly calls up a bewitched alchemical manuscript in the course of her research. Descended from an old and distinguished line of witches, Diana wants nothing to do with sorcery; so after a furtive glance and a few notes, she banishes the book to the stacks. But her discovery sets a fantastical underworld stirring, and a horde of daemons, witches, and vampires soon descends upon the library. Diana has stumbled upon a coveted treasure lost for centuries-and she is the only creature who can break its spell. Debut novelist Deborah Harkness has crafted a mesmerizing and addictive read, equal parts history and magic, romance and suspense. Diana is a bold heroine who meets her equal in vampire geneticist Matthew Clairmont, and gradually warms up to him as their alliance deepens into an intimacy that violates age-old taboos. This smart, sophisticated story harks back to the novels of Anne Rice, but it is as contemporary and sensual as the Twilight series-with an extra serving of historical realism.|Hardcover||579.0|February 8, 2011|Viking||||771.1064|4.0|4.6|405316.0|17123.0|16.3322|4.3942|23.5712|Fantasy|Fiction|Romance|Paranormal|Vampires|Witches|Magic|Urban Fantasy|Paranormal Romance|Supernatural|0.3788896610300363|0.11767431086402595|0.11412246158597793|0.10076441973592773|0.07269708902787429|0.058798548374642885|0.046212647671994435|0.04571075592618331|0.033240676395645125|0.03188942938769207|285130.75

To Be or Not To Be: A Chooseable-Path Adventure|Ryan North|To Be or Not To Be is a choose-your-own-path version of Hamlet by New York Times best-selling author Ryan North. Play as Hamlet, Ophelia, or King Hamlet--if you want to die on the first page and play as a ghost. It's pretty awesome! Readers can follow Yorick skull markers to stick closely to Shakespeare's plot, or go off-script and explore alternative possibilities filled with puzzles and humor.Each ending in the book is accompanied by a full-color, full-page illustration by one of the 65 most excellent artists working today, so each rereading yields new surprises and rewards. Ryan's prose is, as always, colloquial and familiar but full of clever references, vivid imagination, and only the most choice of jokes. Inventive devices like a book-within-a-book (to mirror Hamlet's play-within-a-play) take full advantage of the gamebook medium and liven up the original story for even the most disinterested of Shakespeare readers!To Be or Not to Be became a sensation when it launched: over 15,000 people backed the book in just one month, and it remains the number-one most funded publishing project ever on Kickstarter.com.To be, or not to be: that is the adventure!|Paperback||768.0|September 10, 2013|Breadpig|13 years and up|||1220.1624800000004|4.1|4.7|4238.0|359.0|15.24|3.175|22.86|Humor|Fiction|Graphic Novels|Fantasy|Choose Your Own Adventure|Comics|Classics|Retellings|Young Adult|Comedy|0.2611275964391692|0.19584569732937684|0.129080118694362|0.0771513353115727|0.07566765578635015|0.062314540059347175|0.06083086053412463|0.04896142433234421|0.04451038575667656|0.04451038575667656|201396.15

Prince of Fools|Mark  Lawrence|The Red Queen is old but the kings of the Broken Empire dread her like no other. For all her reign, she has fought the long war, contested in secret, against the powers that stand behind nations, for higher stakes than land or gold. Her greatest weapon is The Silent Sister—unseen by most and unspoken of by all.The Red Queen’s grandson, Prince Jalan Kendeth—drinker, gambler, seducer of women—is one who can see The Silent Sister. Tenth in line for the throne and content with his role as a minor royal, he pretends that the hideous crone is not there. But war is coming. Witnesses claim an undead army is on the march, and the Red Queen has called on her family to defend the realm. Jal thinks it’s all a rumor—nothing that will affect him—but he is wrong.After escaping a death trap set by the Silent Sister, Jal finds his fate magically intertwined with a fierce Norse warrior. As the two undertake a journey across the Empire to undo the spell, encountering grave dangers, willing women, and an upstart prince named Jorg Ancrath along the way, Jalan gradually catches a glimmer of the truth: he and the Norseman are but pieces in a game, part of a series of moves in the long war—and the Red Queen controls the board.|Hardcover||355.0|June 3, 2014|Ace|18 years and up|||544.3104|4.06|4.3|27619.0|1183.0|16.51|3.048|24.13|Fantasy|Fiction|Epic Fantasy|High Fantasy|Adult|Dark Fantasy|Magic|Adventure|Audiobook|Science Fiction Fantasy|0.7432895488292405|0.06025128498001143|0.04026270702455738|0.03283837806967447|0.028555111364934323|0.02627070245573957|0.023129640205596803|0.0211307824100514|0.013706453455168471|0.0105653912050257|274014.26

Perfectly Parvin|Olivia Abtahi|Fourteen-year-old Iranian-American Parvin Mohammadi sets out to win the ultimate date to homecoming in this heartfelt and outright hilarious debut.Parvin has just had her heart broken when she meets the cutest boy at her new high school, Matty Fumero--with an emphasis on fumero, because he might be the smoking hot cure to all of her boy troubles. If Parvin can get Matty to ask her to homecoming, she's positive it will erase all the awful and embarrassing feelings He Who Will Not Be Named left her with after the summer. The only problem is Matty is definitely too cool for bassoon-playing, frizzy-haired, Cheeto-eating Parvin. Since being herself has not worked for her in the past (see aforementioned relationship), she decides that to be the girl who finally gets the guy, she should start acting like the women in her favorite rom-coms. Those girls aren't loud, they certainly don't cackle when they laugh, and they smile much more than they talk. Easy enough, right?But as Parvin struggles through her parent-mandated Farsi lessons on the weekends, a budding friendship with a boy she can't help but be her unfiltered self with, and dealing with the ramifications of the Muslim Ban on her family in Iran, she realizes that being herself might just be the perfect thing after all.|Hardcover||320.0|May 18, 2021|G.P.

In The Violinist's Thumb, he explores the wonders of the magical building block of life: DNA.There are genes to explain crazy cat ladies, why other people have no fingerprints, and why some people survive nuclear bombs. Genes illuminate everything from JFK's bronze skin (it wasn't a tan) to Einstein's genius. They prove that Neanderthals and humans bred thousands of years more recently than any of us would feel comfortable thinking. They can even allow some people, because of the exceptional flexibility of their thumbs and fingers, to become truly singular violinists. Kean's vibrant storytelling makes science entertaining, explaining human history and whimsy while showing how DNA will influence our species' future.|Hardcover||401.0|July 17, 2012|Little, Brown and Company||||648.6365599999998|3.99|4.6|8800|519.0|16.2052|3.3528|23.622000000000003|Science|Nonfiction|History|Biology|Genetics|Popular Science|Evolution|Medicine|Medical|Audiobook|0.4252092050209205|0.3577405857740586|0.08158995815899582|0.045502092050209206|0.030334728033472806|0.013598326359832637|0.013598326359832637|0.01202928870292887|0.011506276150627616|0.008891213389121341|273869.89

The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood|James Gleick|James Gleick, the author of the best sellers Chaos and Genius, now brings us a work just as astonishing and masterly: a revelatory chronicle and meditation that shows how information has become the modern era’s defining quality—the blood, the fuel, the vital principle of our world. The story of information begins in a time profoundly unlike our own, when every thought and utterance vanishes as soon as it is born. From the invention of scripts and alphabets to the long-misunderstood talking drums of Africa, Gleick tells the story of information technologies that changed the very nature of human consciousness. He provides portraits of the key figures contributing to the inexorable development of our modern understanding of information: Charles Babbage, the idiosyncratic inventor of the first great mechanical computer; Ada Byron, the brilliant and doomed daughter of the poet, who became the first true programmer; pivotal figures like Samuel Morse and Alan Turing; and Claude Shannon, the creator of information theory itself. And then the information age arrives. Citizens of this world become experts willy-nilly: aficionados of bits and bytes. And we sometimes feel we are drowning, swept by a deluge of signs and signals, news and images, blogs and tweets. The Information is the story of how we got here and where we are heading.|Hardcover||527.0|March 1, 2011|Pantheon||||1006.97424|4.01|4.4|14678.0|597.0|17.119600000000002|4.699000000000002|24.5364|Science|Nonfiction|History|Technology|Philosophy|Computer Science|Mathematics|Popular Science|Audiobook|Business|0.30162412993039445|0.29499502817368245|0.19754723235001656|0.07855485581703679|0.043420616506463366|0.02154458070931389|0.01756711965528671|0.017235664567451108|0.014584023864766324|0.012926748425588332|1140378.63
The Geeks Shall Inherit the Earth: Popularity, Quirk Theory and Why Outsiders Thrive After High School|Alexandra Robbins|"When school lunchroom doors open, hungry students rush in, searching for tables where they wouldn't be outsiders. Of course, in middle school and high school, almost everyone is an outsider: the nerds, the new girls, the band geeks, the loners; even the ""popular"" cheerleaders. Alexandra Robbins' The Geeks Shall Inherit the Earth takes us inside the hallways of real schools to show us how shifting cliques and permanent marginalization affect children. Following individual students over the course of a year, she tracks the plight and possibilities of self-confessed nerds, freaks, punks, Goths, and weirdos. Her central message is heartening: Our increasingly homogenized society ultimately needs and welcomes the cafeteria fringe."|Hardcover||448.0|May 3, 2011|Hyperion||||748.4268|3.6|4.3|4563.0|121.0|15.5702|23.495||Nonfiction|Psychology|Education|Adult|Science|Sociology|Parenting|Social Science|School|Cultural|0.42940038684719534|0.1895551257253385|0.1586073500967118|0.04642166344294004|0.04061895551257253|0.03481624758220503|0.032882011605415866|0.02707930367504836|0.025145067698259187|0.015473887814313346|238066.13
Personal|Lee Child|You can leave the army, but the army doesn’t leave you. Not always. Not completely, notes Jack Reacher—and sure enough, the retired military cop is soon pulled back into service. This time, for the State Department and the CIA.Someone has taken a shot at the president of France in the City of Light. The bullet was American. The distance between the gunman and the target was exceptional. How many snipers can shoot from three-quarters of a mile with total confidence? Very few, but John Kott—an American marksman gone bad—is one of them. And after fifteen years in prison, he’s out, unaccounted for, and likely drawing a bead on a G8 summit packed with enough world leaders to tempt any assassin.If anyone can stop Kott, it’s the man who beat him before: Reacher. And though he’d rather work alone, Reacher is teamed with Casey Nice, a rookie analyst who keeps her cool with Zoloft. But they’re facing a rough road, full of ruthless mobsters, Serbian thugs, close calls, double-crosses—and no backup if they’re caught. All the while Reacher can’t stop thinking about the woman he once failed to save. But he won’t let that happen again. Not this time. Not Nice.Reacher never gets too close. But now a killer is making it personal.|Hardcover||353.0|September 2, 2014|Delacorte Press||||644.10064|3.96|4.1|62799.0|16629.0|16.002|3.302|23.495|Thriller|Fiction|Mystery|Crime|Action|Mystery Thriller|Suspense|Audiobook|Adventure|Military Fiction|0.2717287488061127|0.24737344794651386|0.16571155682903535|0.08739255014326648|0.05348615090735435|0.04918815663801337|0.048710601719197714|0.031041069723018143|0.024355300859598854|0.02101241642788921|220019.88

Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success|Adam M. Grant|Give and Take highlights what effective networking, collaboration, influence, negotiation, and leadership skills have in common.For generations, we have focused on the individual drivers of success: passion, hard work, talent, and luck. But today, success is increasingly dependent on how we interact with others. It turns out that at work, most people operate as either takers, matchers, or givers. Whereas takers strive to get as much as possible from others and matchers aim to trade evenly, givers are the rare breed of people who contribute to others without expecting anything in return. Using his own pioneering research as Wharton's youngest tenured professor, Grant shows that these styles have a surprising impact on success. Although some givers get exploited and burn out, the rest achieve extraordinary results across a wide range of industries. Combining cutting-edge evidence with captivating stories, this landmark book shows how one of America's best networkers developed his connections, why the creative genius behind one of the most popular shows in television history toiled for years in anonymity, how a basketball executive responsible for multiple draft busts transformed his franchise into a winner, and how we could have anticipated Enron's demise four years before the company collapsed - without ever looking at a single number. Praised by bestselling authors such as Dan Pink, Tony Hsieh, Dan Ariely, Susan Cain, Dan Gilbert, Gretchen Rubin, Bob Sutton, David Allen, Robert Cialdini, and Seth Godin-as well as senior leaders from Google, McKinsey, Merck, Estee Lauder, Nike, and NASA - Give and Take highlights what effective networking, collaboration, influence, negotiation, and leadership skills have in common. This landmark book opens up an approach to success that has the power to transform not just individuals and groups, but entire organizations and communities.|Hardcover||320.0|April 9, 2013|Viking||||521.6307999999998|4.07|4.6|26322.0|2310.0|15.748|2.7940000000000005|23.749|Business|Nonfiction|Psychology|Self Help|Leadership|Personal Development|Management|Buisness|Productivity|Audiobook|0.32566666666666666|0.21166666666666667|0.13766666666666666|0.10266666666666667|0.09433333333333334|0.05566666666666667|0.02733333333333333|0.017666666666666667|0.013666666666666669|0.013666666666666669|234601.25
The Real Macaw|Donna Andrews|During an early-morning feeding for her four-month-old twins, Meg Langslow hears an odd noise and goes downstairs to find her living room filled with cats, dogs, hamsters, gerbils, rabbits, guinea pigs, and a stunningly foul-mouthed macaw. What the—bleep—is going on here?Turns out that a financially-strapped local animal shelter has repealed its no-kill policy and, in an act of protest led in part by Meg’s own zoologist grandfather, the animals have been stolen and resettled around town. But now the volunteer who helped transport the shelter animals has turned up dead. The animal-rights activist’s untimely death seems very, very wrong… Was it the result of a lover’s quarrel? Or is something—or someone—more sinister at play? And, arguably as important, will Meg ever rid her home of these pesky houseguests and get back to the business of nesting with her newborns?

No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State|Glenn Greenwald|By Glenn Greenwald, star of Citizenfour, the Academy Award-winning documentary on Edward SnowdenIn May 2013, Glenn Greenwald set out for Hong Kong to meet an anonymous source who claimed to have astonishing evidence of pervasive government spying and insisted on communicating only through heavily encrypted channels. That source turned out to be the twenty-nine-year-old NSA contractor Edward Snowden, and his revelations about the agency's widespread, systemic overreach proved to be some of the most explosive and consequential news in recent history, triggering a fierce debate over national security and information privacy.Now Greenwald fits all the pieces together, recounting his high-intensity eleven-day trip to Hong Kong, examining the broader implications of the surveillance detailed in his reporting for The Guardian, and revealing fresh information on the NSA's unprecedented abuse of power with documents from the Snowden archive. Fearless and incisive, No Place to Hide has already sparked outrage around the globe and been hailed by voices across the political spectrum as an essential contribution to our understanding of the U.S. surveillance state.|Hardcover||260.0|May 13, 2014|Metropolitan Books||||498.9512|4.08|4.6|13453.0|1515.0|16.0274|2.3368|24.0792|Nonfiction|Politics|History|Technology|Biography|Journalism|American|Audiobook|Espionage|Government|0.43855421686746987|0.2530120481927711|0.113855421686747|0.06325301204819278|0.04216867469879519|0.0355421686746988|0.014457831325301203|0.013855421686746987|0.013855421686746987|0.01144578313253012|212945.75
Heaven's Queen|Rachel Bach|From the moment she took a job on Captain Caldswell's doomed ship, Devi Morris' life has been one disaster after another: government conspiracies, two alien races out for her blood, an incurable virus that's eating her alive. Now, with the captain missing and everyone -- even her own government -- determined to hunt her down, things are going from bad to impossible.

Stay Close|Harlan Coben|Megan is a suburban soccer mom who once upon a time walked on the wild side. Now she’s got two kids, a perfect husband, a picket fence, and a growing sense of dissatisfaction. Ray used to be a talented documentary photographer, but at age forty he finds himself in a dead-end job posing as a paparazzo pandering to celebrity-obsessed rich kids. Jack is a detective who can’t let go of a cold case—a local husband and father disappeared seventeen years ago, and Jack spends the anniversary every year visiting a house frozen in time, the missing man’s family still waiting, his slippers left by the recliner as if he might show up any moment to step into them. Three people living lives they never wanted, hiding secrets that even those closest to them would never suspect, will find that the past doesn’t recede. Even as the terrible consequences of long-ago events crash together in the present and threaten to ruin lives, they will come to the startling realization that they may not want to forget the past at all. And as each confronts the dark side of the American Dream—the boredom of a nice suburban life, the excitement of temptation, the desperation and hunger that can lurk behind even the prettiest facades—they will discover the hard truth that the line between one kind of life and another can be as whisper-thin as a heartbeat. With his trademark combination of page-turning thrills and unrivaled insight into the dark shadows that creep into even the happiest communities, Harlan Coben delivers a thriller that cements his status as the master of domestic suspense.|Hardcover|First Edition|387.0|March 20, 2012|Dutton||||689.45984|3.89|4.4|41219.0|1802.0|16.51|3.81|24.13|Mystery|Thriller|Fiction|Crime|Suspense|Mystery Thriller|Audiobook|Adult|Adult Fiction|Contemporary|0.31220657276995306|0.1705790297339593|0.16666666666666666|0.09780907668231613|0.08998435054773082|0.08137715179968699|0.0297339593114241|0.02112676056338028|0.01877934272300469|0.011737089201877934|342156.9

"Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's ""Learned"""|Lena Dunham|"""There is nothing gutsier to me than a person announcing that their story is one that deserves to be told,"" writes Lena Dunham, and it certainly takes guts to share the stories that make up her first book, Not That Kind of Girl. These are stories about getting your butt touched by your boss, about friendship and dieting (kind of) and having two existential crises before the age of 20. Stories about travel, both successful and less so, and about having the kind of sex where you feel like keeping your sneakers on in case you have to run away during the act. Stories about proving yourself to a room of 50-year-old men in Hollywood and showing up to ""an outlandishly high-fashion event with the crustiest red nose you ever saw."" Fearless, smart, and as heartbreakingly honest as ever, Not That Kind of Girl establishes Lena Dunham as more than a hugely talented director, actress and producer-it announces her as a fresh and vibrant new literary voice."|Hardcover||265.0|September 30, 2014|Random House||||476.2716|3.29|3.8|123057.0|2574.0|14.5796|2.8448|21.6154|Nonfiction|Memoir|Feminism|Biography|Humor|Audiobook|Essays|Autobiography|Biography Memoir|Comedy|0.3481308411214953|0.2135154565061107|0.08554996405463695|0.07764198418404025|0.07638389647735443|0.0603882099209202|0.05697340043134436|0.033608914450035936|0.0296549245147376|0.018152408339324227|153032.19999999998
The Miniaturist|Jessie Burton|"Set in seventeenth century Amsterdam--a city ruled by glittering wealth and oppressive religion--a masterful debut steeped in atmosphere and shimmering with mystery, in the tradition of Emma Donoghue, Sarah Waters, and Sarah Dunant.""There is nothing hidden that will not be revealed . . .""On a brisk autumn day in 1686, eighteen-year-old Nella Oortman arrives in Amsterdam to begin a new life as the wife of illustrious merchant trader Johannes Brandt. But her new home, while splendorous, is not welcoming. Johannes is kind yet distant, always locked in his study or at his warehouse office--leaving Nella alone with his sister, the sharp-tongued and forbidding Marin.But Nella's world changes when Johannes presents her with an extraordinary wedding gift: a cabinet-sized replica of their home. To furnish her gift, Nella engages the services of a miniaturist--an elusive and enigmatic artist whose tiny creations mirror their real-life counterparts in eerie and unexpected ways . . .Johannes' gift helps Nella to pierce the closed world of the Brandt household. But as she uncovers its unusual secrets, she begins to understand--and fear--the escalating dangers that await them all. In this repressively pious society where gold is worshipped second only to God, to be different is a threat to the moral fabric of society, and not even a man as rich as Johannes is safe. Only one person seems to see the fate that awaits them. Is the miniaturist the key to their salvation . . . or the architect of their destruction?Enchanting, beautiful, and exquisitely suspenseful, The Miniaturist is a magnificent story of love and obsession, betrayal and retribution, appearance and truth."|Hardcover||400.0|August 26, 2014|Ecco||||612.3492|3.6|4.0|122435.0|5413.0|15.24|3.2766|22.86|Historical Fiction|Fiction|Historical|Mystery|Fantasy|Magical Realism|Adult|Audiobook|Adult Fiction|Literary Fiction|0.440720294426919|0.22016298633017875|0.10620399579390116|0.06821766561514196|0.04442691903259727|0.034831756046267086|0.02786540483701367|0.022344900105152467|0.022344900105152467|0.01288117770767613|561743.6699999999
Money Shot|Rae Armantrout|"The poems in Money Shot are forensic. Just as the money shot in porn is proof of the male orgasm, these poems explore questions of revelation and concealment. What is seen, what is hidden, and how do we know? Money Shot's investigation of these questions takes on a particular urgency because it occurs in the context of the suddenly revealed market manipulation and subsequent ""great recession"" of 2008-2009. In these poems, Rae Armantrout searches for new ways to organize information. What can be made manifest? What constitutes proof? Do we ""know it when we see it""? Looking at sex, botany, cosmology, and death through the dark lens of ""disaster capitalism,"" Armantrout finds evidence of betrayal, grounds for rebellion, moments of possibility, and even pleasure, in a time of sudden scarcity and relentless greed. This stunning follow-up to Versed--winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award, and a finalist for the National Book Award--is a wonderfully stringent exploration of how deeply our experience of everyday life is embedded in capitalism."|Hardcover||77.0|February 8, 2011|Wesleyan||||4445.2016|3.88|3.8|175.0|7.0|15.875|1.905|23.495|Poetry|American|||||||||0.9649122807017544|0.03508771929824561|||||||||378393.77

Annihilation|Jeff VanderMeer|Area X has been cut off from the rest of the world for decades. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; the second expedition ended in mass suicide, the third in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another. The members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within weeks, all had died of cancer. In Annihilation, the first volume of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach Trilogy, we join the twelfth expedition.The group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain, record all observations of their surroundings and of one another, and, above all, avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers—but it’s the surprises that came across the border with them and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another that change everything.|Paperback||195.0|February 4, 2014|FSG Originals||||2540.1152|3.71|4.1|165254.0|4232.0|13.081|1.3970000000000002|19.0754|Science Fiction|Fiction|Horror|Fantasy|Mystery|Dystopia|Audiobook|Science Fiction Fantasy|Adult|Thriller|0.3254914099984523|0.2192385079709024|0.18193778052932985|0.08342361863488625|0.04666460300263117|0.03366351957901253|0.03242532115771552|0.028942888097817674|0.025150905432595568|0.023061445596656863|86622.0
Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald|Therese Anne Fowler|When beautiful, reckless Southern belle Zelda Sayre meets F. Scott Fitzgerald at a country club dance in 1918, she is seventeen years old and he is a young army lieutenant. Before long, Zelda has fallen for him, even though Scott isn't wealthy or prominent or even a Southerner, and keeps insisting, absurdly, that his writing will bring him both fortune and fame. When he sells his first novel, she optimistically boards a train to New York, to marry him and take the rest as it comes.What comes, here at the dawn of the Jazz Age, is unimagined success and celebrity that will make Scott and Zelda legends in their own time. Each place they go becomes a playground—New York City, Long Island, Hollywood, Paris, and the French Riviera—where they join the endless party of the glamorous, sometimes doomed Lost Generation that includes Ernest Hemingway, Sara and Gerald Murphy, and Gertrude Stein.Everything seems new and possible, but not even Jay Gatsby’s parties go on forever. Who is Zelda, other than the wife of a famous—sometimes infamous—husband? With brilliant insight and imagination, Therese Anne Fowler brings us Zelda’s irresistible story as she herself might have told it.|Hardcover|First edition |375.0|March 26, 2013|St. Martin's Press||||585.13368|3.85|4.4|49841|1319.0|15.5956|2.2352|23.393400000000003|Historical Fiction|Fiction|Historical|Audiobook|Romance|Adult|Adult Fiction|France|Book Club|Novels|0.5205078125|0.24967447916666666|0.0673828125|0.0419921875|0.02734375|0.02734375|0.025065104166666668|0.013997395833333334|0.013346354166666666|0.013346354166666666|284697.64
Deathless|Catherynne M. Valente|Koschei the Deathless is to Russian folklore what devils or wicked witches are to European culture: a menacing, evil figure; the villain of countless stories which have been passed on through story and text for generations. But Koschei has never before been seen through the eyes of Catherynne Valente, whose modernized and transformed take on the legend brings the action to modern times, spanning many of the great developments of Russian history in the twentieth century.Deathless, however, is no dry, historical tome: it lights up like fire as the young Marya Morevna transforms from a clever child of the revolution, to Koschei’s beautiful bride, to his eventual undoing. Along the way there are Stalinist house elves, magical quests, secrecy and bureaucracy, and games of lust and power. All told, Deathless is a collision of magical history and actual history, of revolution and mythology, of love and death, which will bring Russian myth back to life in a stunning new incarnation.|Hardcover||352.0|March 29, 2011|Tor Books||||6758.5208|3.99|4.4|16743.0|296.0|15.0622|3.2512000000000003|21.4884|Fantasy|Historical Fiction|Fiction|Mythology|Historical|Fairy Tales|Russia|Retellings|Adult|Romance|0.44555927164622816|0.13823857302118173|0.09866220735785954|0.06447417316982534|0.05258268301746562|0.049609810479375696|0.041991824600520256|0.039204756596060944|0.03567447045707915|0.03400222965440357|346488.0

The Lowland|Jhumpa Lahiri|Epic in its canvas and intimate in its portrayal of lives undone and forged anew, The Lowland is a deeply felt novel of family ties that entangle and fray in ways unforeseen and unrevealed, of ties that ineluctably define who we areFrom Subhash's earliest memories, at every point, his brother was there. In the suburban streets of Calcutta where they wandered before dusk and in the hyacinth-strewn ponds where they played for hours on end, Udayan was always in his older brother's sight. So close in age, they were inseparable in childhood and yet, as the years pass - as U.S tanks roll into Vietnam and riots sweep across India - their brotherly bond can do nothing to forestall the tragedy that will upend their lives. Udayan - charismatic and impulsive - finds himself drawn to the Naxalite movement, a rebellion waged to eradicate inequity and poverty. He will give everything, risk all, for what he believes, and in doing so will transform the futures of those dearest to him: his newly married, pregnant wife, his brother and their parents. For all of them, the repercussions of his actions will reverberate across continents and seep through the generations that follow. Epic in its canvas and intimate in its portrayal of lives undone and forged anew, The Lowland is a deeply felt novel of family ties that entangle and fray in ways unforeseen and unrevealed, of ties that ineluctably define who we are. With all the hallmarks of Jhumpa Lahiri's achingly poignant, exquisitely empathetic story-telling, this is her most devastating work of fiction to date.|Hardcover|1st|340.0|September 24, 2013|Knopf||||657.7084|3.85|4.2|88450|2339.0|2.54|15.24|22.86|Fiction|India|Historical Fiction|Literary Fiction|Novels|Contemporary|Asia|Audiobook|Literature|Indian Literature|0.4975096845600443|0.1505257332595462|0.1200885445489762|0.05617044825677919|0.033757609297177645|0.032927504150525734|0.029883785279468725|0.027116768123962368|0.026563364692861097|0.02545655783065855|372474.6

Both heartbreaking and hopeful, The Anatomy of Being marks a very distinct time in a young girl's life, and aches and aches to be heard and devoured. 2013 Goodreads Choice Awards Poetry Finalist|Paperback|First Edition|102.0|April 6, 2013|lulu.com||||2676.1928000000007|4.27|4.6|4177.0|222.0|15.24|0.6604|22.86|Poetry|Nonfiction|Contemporary|Adult|21st Century|Romance|Womens|Love|Asian Literature|Self Help|0.9454756380510441|0.023201856148491882|0.0058004640371229705|0.004640371229698376|0.004640371229698376|0.004640371229698376|0.0034802784222737818|0.0034802784222737818|0.002320185614849188|0.002320185614849188|240953.53000000003

The Paris Wife|Paula McLain|A deeply evocative story of ambition and betrayal, The Paris Wife captures a remarkable period of time and a love affair between two unforgettable people: Ernest Hemingway and his wife Hadley. Chicago, 1920: Hadley Richardson is a quiet twenty-eight-year-old who has all but given up on love and happiness—until she meets Ernest Hemingway and her life changes forever. Following a whirlwind courtship and wedding, the pair set sail for Paris, where they become the golden couple in a lively and volatile group—the fabled “Lost Generation”—that includes Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. Though deeply in love, the Hemingways are ill prepared for the hard-drinking and fast-living life of Jazz Age Paris, which hardly values traditional notions of family and monogamy. Surrounded by beautiful women and competing egos, Ernest struggles to find the voice that will earn him a place in history, pouring all the richness and intensity of his life with Hadley and their circle of friends into the novel that will become The Sun Also Rises. Hadley, meanwhile, strives to hold on to her sense of self as the demands of life with Ernest grow costly and her roles as wife, friend, and muse become more challenging. Despite their extraordinary bond, they eventually find themselves facing the ultimate crisis of their marriage—a deception that will lead to the unraveling of everything they’ve fought so hard for. A heartbreaking portrayal of love and torn loyalty, The Paris Wife is all the more poignant because we know that, in the end, Hemingway wrote that he would rather have died than fallen in love with anyone but Hadley.|Hardcover||314.0|February 22, 2011|Ballantine Books||||612.3492|3.81|4.4|277463.0|4355.0|16.8402|2.4384|24.2062|Historical Fiction|Fiction|Historical|Romance|France|Book Club|Adult Fiction|Audiobook|Adult|Novels|0.4720625431133594|0.25948493906645204|0.05679466544033111|0.04575764543573235|0.04115888710048287|0.0400091975166705|0.024143481260059784|0.024028512301678545|0.022648884801103702|0.013911243964129684|268239.46

The Wise Man's Fear|Patrick Rothfuss|“There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.”My name is Kvothe.I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.You may have heard of me.So begins the tale of a hero told from his own point of view — a story unequaled in fantasy literature. Now in The Wise Man's Fear, an escalating rivalry with a powerful member of the nobility forces Kvothe to leave the University and seek his fortune abroad. Adrift, penniless, and alone, he travels to Vintas, where he quickly becomes entangled in the politics of courtly society. While attempting to curry favor with a powerful noble, Kvothe uncovers an assassination attempt, comes into conflict with a rival arcanist, and leads a group of mercenaries into the wild, in an attempt to solve the mystery of who (or what) is waylaying travelers on the King's Road.All the while, Kvothe searches for answers, attempting to uncover the truth about the mysterious Amyr, the Chandrian, and the death of his parents. Along the way, Kvothe is put on trial by the legendary Adem mercenaries, is forced to reclaim the honor of the Edema Ruh, and travels into the Fae realm. There he meets Felurian, the faerie woman no man can resist, and who no man has ever survived ... until Kvothe.In The Wise Man's Fear, Kvothe takes his first steps on the path of the hero and learns how difficult life can be when a man becomes a legend in his own time.|Hardcover|First Edition|994.0|March 1, 2011|DAW||||1288.20128|4.54|4.7|455022.0|13710.0|15.748|4.572|23.368|Fantasy|Fiction|Epic Fantasy|High Fantasy|Magic|Science Fiction Fantasy|Adventure|Audiobook|Adult|Epic|0.7371719872973425|0.09284639812802943|0.03819154270432893|0.02599030586662209|0.02264750125355173|0.021017884004679927|0.02039110813972924|0.018260070198896874|0.013872639144242018|0.009610563262577304|243407.82
That This|Susan Howe|"“What treasures of knowledge we cluster around.” That This is a collection in three pieces. “Disappearance Approach,” an essay about the sudden death of the author’s husband (“land of darkness or darkness itself you shadow mouth”), begins the book with paintings by Poussin, an autopsy, Sarah Edwards and her sister-in-law Hannah, phantoms, elusive remnants, and snakes. “Frolic Architecture,” the second section — inspired by visits to the vast 18th-century Jonathan Edwards archives at the Beinecke and accompanied by six black-and-white photograms by James Welling — presents hauntingly lovely, oblique text-collages that Howe (with scissors and “invisible” Scotch Tape and a Canon copier) has twisted, flattened, and snipped into “inscapes of force.” The final section, “That This,” delivers beautiful short squares of verse that might look at home in a hymnal, although their orderly appearance packs startling power:

Finn) No Exit—a riveting new psychological page-turner featuring a fierce and unforgettable heroine.Three months ago, Lena Nguyen’s estranged twin sister, Cambry, drove to a remote bridge sixty miles outside of Missoula, Montana, and jumped two hundred feet to her death.

The Underground Girls of Kabul: In Search of a Hidden Resistance in Afghanistan|Jenny Nordberg|"An investigative journalist uncovers a hidden custom that will transform your understanding of what it means to grow up as a girl.In Afghanistan, a culture ruled almost entirely by men, the birth of a son is cause for celebration and the arrival of a daughter is often mourned as misfortune. A bacha posh (literally translated from Dari as ""dressed up like a boy"") is a third kind of child – a girl temporarily raised as a boy and presented as such to the outside world. Jenny Nordberg, the reporter who broke the story of this phenomenon for the New York Times, constructs a powerful and moving account of those secretly living on the other side of a deeply segregated society where women have almost no rights and little freedom. The Underground Girls of Kabul is anchored by vivid characters who bring this remarkable story to life: Azita, a female parliamentarian who sees no other choice but to turn her fourth daughter Mehran into a boy; Zahra, the tomboy teenager who struggles with puberty and refuses her parents' attempts to turn her back into a girl; Shukria, now a married mother of three after living for twenty years as a man; and Nader, who prays with Shahed, the undercover female police officer, as they both remain in male disguise as adults. At the heart of this emotional narrative is a new perspective on the extreme sacrifices of Afghan women and girls against the violent backdrop of America's longest war. Divided into four parts, the book follows those born as the unwanted sex in Afghanistan, but who live as the socially favored gender through childhood and puberty, only to later be forced into marriage and childbirth. The Underground Girls of Kabul charts their dramatic life cycles, while examining our own history and the parallels to subversive actions of people who live under oppression everywhere."|Hardcover||350.0|September 16, 2014|Crown||||612.3492|4.1|4.5|10824.0|504.0|16.5862|3.0988|24.1554|Nonfiction|Feminism|History|Politics|Womens|Religion|Gender|Adult|Audiobook|Biography|0.5540246555474981|0.11602610587382164|0.10804931109499638|0.06961566352429296|0.04496011602610588|0.02320522117476433|0.02175489485134156|0.02175489485134156|0.02030456852791878|0.02030456852791878|260876.59

Some Kind of Fairy Tale|Graham Joyce|It is Christmas afternoon and Peter Martin gets an unexpected phone call from his parents, asking him to come round. It pulls him away from his wife and children and into a bewildering mystery.He arrives at his parents house and discovers that they have a visitor. His sister Tara. Not so unusual you might think, this is Christmas after all, a time when families get together. But twenty years ago Tara took a walk into the woods and never came back and as the years have gone by with no word from her the family have, unspoken, assumed that she was dead. Now she's back, tired, dirty, disheveled, but happy and full of stories about twenty years spent traveling the world, an epic odyssey taken on a whim.But her stories don't quite hang together and once she has cleaned herself up and got some sleep it becomes apparent that the intervening years have been very kind to Tara. She really does look no different from the young woman who walked out the door twenty years ago. Peter's parents are just delighted to have their little girl back, but Peter and his best friend Richie, Tara's one time boyfriend, are not so sure. Tara seems happy enough but there is something about her. A haunted, otherworldly quality. Some would say it's as if she's off with the fairies. And as the months go by Peter begins to suspect that the woods around their homes are not finished with Tara and his family...|Hardcover||310.0|July 10, 2012|Doubleday||||589.6696|3.6|4.3|9034.0|357.0|16.002|4.3180000000000005|24.13|Fantasy|Fiction|Mystery|Magical Realism|Fairy Tales|Audiobook|Paranormal|Adult|Magic|Urban Fantasy|0.4793977812995245|0.20364500792393028|0.08954041204437402|0.05625990491283677|0.04120443740095087|0.028526148969889063|0.028526148969889063|0.02614896988906497|0.02377179080824089|0.022979397781299524|129499.89
Life Itself|Roger Ebert|"Roger Ebert is the best-known film critic of our time. He has been reviewing films for the Chicago Sun-Times since 1967, and was the first film critic ever to win a Pulitzer Prize. He has appeared on television for four decades, including twenty-three years as cohost of Siskel & Ebert at the Movies.In 2006, complications from thyroid cancer treatment resulted in the loss of his ability to eat, drink, or speak. But with the loss of his voice, Ebert has only become a more prolific and influential writer. And now, for the first time, he tells the full, dramatic story of his life and career.Roger Ebert's journalism carried him on a path far from his nearly idyllic childhood in Urbana, Illinois. It is a journey that began as a reporter for his local daily, and took him to Chicago, where he was unexpectedly given the job of film critic for the Sun-Times, launching a lifetime's adventures.In this candid, personal history, Ebert chronicles it all: his loves, losses, and obsessions; his struggle and recovery from alcoholism; his marriage; his politics; and his spiritual beliefs. He writes about his years at the Sun-Times, his colorful newspaper friends, and his life-changing collaboration with Gene Siskel. He remembers his friendships with Studs Terkel, Mike Royko, Oprah Winfrey, and Russ Meyer (for whom he wrote Beyond the Valley of the Dolls and an ill-fated Sex Pistols movie). He shares his insights into movie stars and directors like John Wayne, Werner Herzog, and Martin Scorsese.This is a story that only Roger Ebert could tell. Filled with the same deep insight, dry wit, and sharp observations that his readers have long cherished, this is more than a memoir-it is a singular, warm-hearted, inspiring look at life itself.""I believe that if, at the end, according to our abilities, we have done something to make others a little happier, and something to make ourselves a little happier, that is about the best we can do. To make others less happy is a crime. To make ourselves unhappy is where all crime starts. We must try to contribute joy to the world. That is true no matter what our problems, our health, our circumstances. We must try. I didn't always know this, and am happy I lived long enough to find it out.""-from LIFE ITSELF"|Hardcover||436.0|September 13, 2011|Grand Central Publishing||||721.21128|3.91|4.4|5879.0|266.0|16.51|3.81|24.13|Nonfiction|Memoir|Biography|Film|Autobiography|Biography Memoir|Audiobook|Media Tie In|History|Unfinished|0.26572668112798264|0.23427331887201736|0.18546637744034708|0.08351409978308026|0.06724511930585682|0.05856832971800434|0.0455531453362256|0.03904555314533623|0.01193058568329718|0.008676789587852495|380126.21

Pops: Learning to Be a Son and a Father|Craig Melvin|"A powerful, intimate memoir and exploration of fatherhood and race from Craig Melvin, news anchor of NBC’s Today show. For Craig Melvin this book is more an investigation than a memoir. It's an opportunity to better understand his father; to interrogate his family's legacy of addiction and despair but also transformation and redemption; and to explore the challenges facing all dads--including Craig himself, a father of two young children.Growing up in Columbia, South Carolina, Craig had a fraught relationship with his father. Lawrence Melvin was a distant, often absent parent due to his drinking as well as his job working the graveyard shift at a postal facility. Watching sports and tinkering on Lawrence's beloved (but unreliable) 1973 Pontiac LeMans were two ways father and son connected, but as Lawrence's drinking spiraled out of control, their bond was stretched to the breaking point. Fortunately, Craig had a loving, fiercely protective mother who held the family together. He also had a series of surrogate father figures in his life--uncles, teachers, workplace mentors--who by their examples helped him figure out the kind of person and father he wanted to be.Pops is the story of all these men--and of the inspiring fathers Craig has met reporting his ""Dads Got This Series"" on the Today show. Pops is also the story of Craig and Lawrence Melvin's long journey to reconciliation and understanding, and of how all these experiences and encounters have informed Craig's understanding of his own role as a dad."|Hardcover||208.0|June 15, 2021|William Morrow||||453.592|0.0||0||15.24|1.9558|22.86|||||||||||||||||||||324688.13
Bad Monkey|Carl Hiaasen|Carl Hiaasen is back doing what he does best: spinning a wickedly funny, fiercely pointed tale in which the greedy, the corrupt, and the degraders of pristine land in Florida--now, in the Bahamas too--get their comeuppance in mordantly ingenious, diabolically entertaining fashion.Andrew Yancy--late of the Miami Police, soon-to-be-late of the Key West Police--has a human arm in his freezer. There's a logical (Hiaasenian) explanation for that, but not for how and why it parted from its owner. Yancy thinks the boating-accident/shark-luncheon explanation is full of holes, and if he can prove murder, his commander might relieve him of Health Inspector duties, aka Roach Patrol. But first Yancy will negotiate an ever-surprising course of events--from the Keys to Miami to a Bahamian out island--with a crew of equally ever-surprising characters, including: the twitchy widow of the frozen arm; an avariciously idiotic real estate developer; a voodoo witch whose lovers are blinded-unto-death by her particularly peculiar charms; Yancy's new love, a kinky medical examiner; and the eponymous Bad Monkey, who earns his place among Hiaasen's greatest characters with hilariously wicked aplomb.|Hardcover||317.0|June 11, 2013|Knopf||||671.31616|3.69|4.3|39468.0|3757.0|16.662399999999998|3.3274000000000004|24.13|Fiction|Mystery|Humor|Crime|Audiobook|Comedy|Mystery Thriller|Contemporary|Adult Fiction|Adult|0.30310880829015546|0.2305699481865285|0.20725388601036268|0.07979274611398962|0.05544041450777202|0.040414507772020734|0.021761658031088083|0.021243523316062177|0.021243523316062177|0.01917098445595855|197353.79
The Unwords|Non Nomen|"""There is nothing more dangerous...than a character with no author.""*This is the first edtition of The Unwords and it is now out of print. It was only available for a limited number of copies exclusively through the author's official website in 2012. The second edition was published in 2013 by Fearache Publishings and it's available worldwide through all major book retailers in paperback, hardcover, and available exclusively from Amazon in eBook format.*A nameless character. A faceless figure. A disturbing, thought-provoking journey through the facts of the world we live in that we often refuse to acknowledge. The Unwords take full advantage of their author's lack of identity and extreme levels of introspection as they unleash a full scale attack on all fronts of cultural and social decay. Education, religion, politics, language, relationships and common every day social activities are stripped down to their bare foundations and deconstructed through the eyes of a man who considers every act of deceit as an act of war against the people he loves. Poetic verse blends seamlessly with the arts in the form of full page illustrations to create a new, refreshing form of writing the author describes as “Graphic-verse.”Words are meant to be spoken. In a dishonest world, what remains unspoken can only be the truth. In a dishonest world......the pen is never mightier than the sword."|Paperback|First Edition (out of print)|90.0|November 20, 2015|Fearache Publishings||||3356.5808|3.61|3.7|261|72.0|15.24|0.635|22.86|Poetry|Nonfiction|Philosophy|Amazon|Sociology|Adult|Linguistics|Horror|Graphic Novels|Art|0.5520833333333334|0.19791666666666666|0.07291666666666667|0.03125|0.03125|0.03125|0.020833333333333332|0.020833333333333332|0.020833333333333332|0.020833333333333332|259721.63
Eighty Days: Nellie Bly and Elizabeth Bisland's History-Making Race Around the World|Matthew Goodman|1889: Two women, successful journalists and writers, set off in a desperate rate in opposite directions, each determined to outdo Jules Verne's fictional hero Phileas Fogg and circle the globe in less than eighty days.On November 14, 1889, Nellie Bly, the crusading young female reporter for Joseph Pulitzer's World newspaper, left New York City by steamship on a quest to break the record for the fastest trip around the world. Also departing from New York that day—and heading in the opposite direction by train - was a young journalist from The Cosmopolitan magazine, Elizabeth Bisland. Each woman was determined to outdo Jules Verne's fictional hero Phileas Fogg and circle the globe in less than eighty days. The dramatic race that ensued would span twenty-eight thousand miles, captivate the nation, and change both competitors' lives forever. The two women were a study in contrasts. Nellie Bly was a scrappy, hard-driving, ambitious reporter from Pennsylvania coal country who sought out the most sensational news stories, often going undercover to expose social injustice. Genteel and elegant, Elizabeth Bisland had been born into an aristocratic Southern family, preferred novels and poetry to newspapers, and was widely referred to as the most beautiful woman in metropolitan journalism. Both women, though, were talented writers who had carved out successful careers in the hypercompetitive, male-dominated world of big-city newspapers. Eighty Days brings these trailblazing women to life as they race against time and each other, unaided and alone, ever aware that the slightest delay could mean the difference between victory and defeat. A vivid real-life re-creation of the race and its aftermath, from its frenzied start to the nail-biting dash at its finish, Eighty Days is history with the heart of a great adventure novel. Here's the journey that takes us behind the walls of Jules Verne's Amiens estate, into the back alleys of Hong Kong, onto the grounds of a Ceylon tea plantation, through storm-tossed ocean crossings and mountains blocked by snowdrifts twenty feet deep, and to many more unexpected and exotic locales from London to Yokohama. Along the way, we are treated to fascinating glimpses of everyday life in the late nineteenth century - an era of unprecedented technological advances, newly remade in the image of the steamship, the railroad, and the telegraph. For Nellie Bly and Elizabeth Bisland - two women ahead of their time in every sense of the word—were not only racing around the world. They were also racing through the very heart of the Victorian age.|Hardcover||453.0|February 26, 2013|Ballantine Books||||793.7860000000002|3.72|4.3|5617.0|292.0|16.154400000000006|2.9464|24.2316|Nonfiction|History|Travel|Biography|Adventure|Historical|Biography Memoir|Womens|American History|Adult|0.3322475570032573|0.2679153094462541|0.11970684039087948|0.11156351791530944|0.03990228013029316|0.03990228013029316|0.025244299674267102|0.02280130293159609|0.02280130293159609|0.017915309446254073|114485.41

The Backup Boyfriend|River Jaymes|Professionally, Dr. Alec Johnson has almost reached his goals. As this year’s recipient of a humanitarian award with his ex, Dr. Tyler Hall, Alec’s work with the homeless is about to be recognized. Unfortunately, his personal life sucks because now he has to attend several events alongside Tyler—with his ex’s new boyfriend in tow. In an attempt to lift his mood and break out of his rut, Alec purchases a motorcycle he has no idea how to start.  Dylan Booth doesn't have time for Dr. Clueless and his fickle 1964 Harley, but the cocky mechanic can’t say no to the request for help. Having spent his teen years on the streets, and losing his best friend to HIV, Dylan decides teaching the do-gooder how to ride is the least he can do. But watching Alec flounder in his ex's company throws Dylan into protector mode, and the confirmed hetero introduces himself as Alec's new boyfriend.  The ex suspects Dylan is lying.  Alec claims Dylan’s plan is insane.  And Dylan’s not sure he can fake being gay.  But he’s a master bullshitter, and the phony PDA soon turns ultra-hot. Alec can’t afford to get attached, and Dylan’s learned everyone eventually leaves. Unfortunately, playing the backup boyfriend is starting to feel way too real…  CONTENT WARNING: This book contains Man-on-Man action, adult situations, and language.|Kindle Edition||279.0|||||||3.97|4.5|10227.0|525.0||||M M Romance|Romance|Contemporary|Gay For You|LGBT|Contemporary Romance|Gay|Adult|Erotica|Fiction|0.4229408792319353|0.1819100555836281|0.12632642748863065|0.07933299646286003|0.05255179383527034|0.0404244567963618|0.032339565437089435|0.024759979787771603|0.02223345123799899|0.017180394138453764|57603.63000000001
Perseverance Through Severe Dysfunction: Breaking the Curse of Intergenerational Trauma as a Black Man in America|Reggie D. Ford|In Reggie Ford’s bold reassessment of the Black experience in America, he demonstrates that a new understanding of PTSD is required. PTSD, Perseverance Through Severe Dysfunction, as Ford defines it, underlines the darkness of mental health illnesses and behaviors that impact young Black men and have plagued Black Americans for generations.But his reassessment is not doom and gloom. Instead, Ford implores that we turn pain into peace. His uplifting message shows that by realizing, accepting, and treating mental health with grace, kindness, and appreciation of the backgrounds of those needing support, we can reduce the significant impact of PTSD and other mental conditions on not just Black, but all people.Ford uses his own traumatic experiences to inform his call to action. He takes his impoverished and scarred childhood and turns it into a life of promise and abundance. His memoir shines a light on the intergenerational impact of unaddressed mental health issues, showing how the power of a familial network can help or severely harm an individual’s battle with mental health illnesses. He writes searingly of the overwhelming odds and systemic racism that must be overcome by Black Americans in order to reach the heights he has scaled. Ford’s own heartbreaking story is yet an optimistic one, intended to show that mental health has a real and demonstrable effect on Black Americans, but that it can be overcome.PTSD places one man’s experiences in the realm of the broad sociopolitical issues that affect so many Americans. Ford emphasizes that the trauma of society creates situations of mental health issues and behaviors that hold back so many. But he also believes there is room for hope, that his own experiences of overcoming so many hardships and difficulties offer a path for others to follow. Immense suffering, Ford believes, can lead to improbable success.|Kindle Edition||279.0|June 19, 2021|Ella Wenthom Books|||||5.0||"1
